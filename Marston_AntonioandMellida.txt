  _Enter_ GALEATZO, PIERO, ALBERTO, ANTONIO, FOROBOSCO, BALURDO,    MATZAGENTE, _and_ FELICHE, _with parts in their hands; having    cloaks cast over their apparel_.  _Gal._ Come, sirs, come! the music will sound straight for entrance.  Are ye ready, are ye perfect?  _Pier._ Faith! we can say our parts; but we are ignorant in what  mould we must cast our actors.  _Alb._ Whom do you personate?  _Pier._ Piero, Duke of Venice.  _Alb._ O! ho! then thus frame your exterior shape  To haughty form of elate majesty,  As if you held the palsy-shaking head  Of reeling chance under your fortune's belt                      10  In strictest vassalage: grow big in thought,  As swoln with glory of successful arms.  _Pier._ If that be all, fear not; I'll suit it right.  Who cannot be proud, stroke up the hair, and strut?  _Alb._ Truth; such rank custom is grown popular;  And now the vulgar fashion strides as wide,  And stalks as proud upon the weakest stilts  Of the slight'st fortunes, as if Hercules  Or burly Atlas shoulder'd up their state.  _Pier._ Good: but whom act you?                                  20  _Alb._ The necessity[36] of the play forceth me to act two  parts: Andrugio, the distressed Duke of Genoa, and  Alberto, a Venetian gentleman, enamoured on the Lady  Rossaline; whose fortunes being too weak to sustain  the port of her, he proved always disastrous in love; his  worth being much underpoised by the uneven scale, that  currents all things by the outward stamp of opinion.  _Gal._ Well, and what dost thou play?  _Bal._ The part of all the world.  _Alb._ The part of all the world? What's that?                   30  _Bal._ The fool. Ay, in good deed law now, I play  Balurdo, a wealthy mountbanking burgomasco's heir of  Venice.  _Alb._ Ha! ha! one whose foppish nature might seem  great, only for wise men's recreation; and, like a juiceless  bark, to preserve the sap of more strenuous spirits.  A servile hound, that loves the scent of forerunning  fashion, like an empty hollow vault, still giving an echo  to wit: greedily champing what any other well valued  judgment had beforehand chew'd.[37]                              40  _Foro._ Ha! ha! ha! tolerably good, good faith, sweet  wag.  _Alb._ Umph; why tolerably good, good faith, sweet  wag? Go, go; you flatter me.  _Foro._ Right; I but dispose my speech to the habit  of my part.  _Alb._ Why, what plays he?                           [_To_ FELICHE.  _Feli._ The wolf that eats into the breasts of princes;  that breeds the lethargy and falling sickness in honour;  makes justice look asquint; and blinds[38] the eye of  merited reward from viewing desertful virtue.                    51  _Alb._ What's all this periphrasis, ha?  _Feli._ The substance of a supple-chapt flatterer.  _Alb._ O! doth he play Forobosco the Parasite? Good,  i'faith. Sirrah, you must seem now as glib and straight  in outward semblance as a lady's busk,[39] though inwardly  as cross as a pair of tailors' legs; having a tongue as  nimble as his needle, with servile patches of glavering  flattery to stitch up the bracks[40] of unworthily  honour'd--                                                       60  _Foro._ I warrant you, I warrant you, you shall see me  prove the very periwig to cover the bald pate of brainless  gentility. Ho! I will so tickle the sense of _bella  gratiosa madonna_ with the titillation of hyperbolical praise,  that I'll strike it in the nick, in the very nick, chuck.  _Feli._ Thou promisest more than I hope any spectator  gives faith of performance; but why look you so dusky,  ha?                                                  [_To_ ANTONIO.  _Ant._ I was never worse fitted since the nativity of my  actorship; I shall be hiss'd at, on my life now.                 70  _Feli._ Why, what must you play?  _Ant._ Faith, I know not what; an hermaphrodite, two  parts in one; my true person being Antonio, son to the  Duke of Genoa; though for the love of Mellida, Piero's  daughter, I take this feigned presence of an Amazon,  calling myself Florizell, and I know not what. I a voice  to play a lady! I shall ne'er do it.  _Alb._ O! an Amazon should have such a voice,  virago-like. Not play two parts in one? away, away,  'tis common fashion. Nay, if you cannot bear two  subtle fronts under one hood, idiot, go by, go by, off  this world's stage! O time's impurity!                           82  _Ant._ Ay, but when use hath taught me action  To hit the right point of a lady's part,  I shall grow ignorant, when I must turn  Young prince again, how but to truss[41] my hose.  _Feli._ Tush, never put them off; for women wear the  breeches still.  _Mat._ By the bright honour of a Milanoise,  And the resplendent fulgor of this steel,                        90  I will defend the feminine to death,  And ding[42] his spirit to the verge of hell,  That dares divulge a lady's prejudice!                  [_Exeunt_ MATZAGENTE, FOROBOSCO, _and_ BALURDO.[43]  _Feli._ Rampum scrampum, mount tufty Tamburlaine!  What rattling thunderclap breaks from his lips?  _Alb._ O! 'tis native to his part. For acting a modern[44]  braggadoch under the person of Matzagente, the Duke  of Milan's son, it may seem to suit with good fashion  of coherence.                                                    99  _Pier._ But methinks he speaks with a spruce Attic  accent of adulterate Spanish.  _Alb._ So 'tis resolv'd. For Milan being half Spanish,  half high Dutch, and half Italians, the blood of chiefest  houses is corrupt and mongrel'd; so that you shall see  a fellow vain-glorious for a Spaniard, gluttonous for a  Dutchman, proud for an Italian, and a fantastic idiot  for all. Such a one conceit this Matzagente.  _Feli._ But I have a part allotted me, which I have  neither able apprehension to conceit, nor what I conceit  gracious ability to utter.                                      110  _Gal._ Whoop, in the old cut![45] Good, show us a  draught of thy spirit.  _Feli._ 'Tis steady and must seem so impregnably fortressed  with his own content that no envious thought  could ever invade his spirit; never surveying any man  so unmeasuredly happy, whom I thought not justly  hateful for some true impoverishment; never beholding  any favour of Madam Felicity gracing another, which  his well-bounded content persuaded not to hang in  the front of his own fortune; and therefore as far  from envying any man, as he valued all men infinitely  distant from accomplished beatitude. These native  adjuncts appropriate to me the name of Feliche. But  last, good, thy humour.                                         124                        [_Exeunt_ PIERO, ALBERTO, _and_ GALEATZO.[46]  _Ant._ 'Tis to be described by signs and tokens. For  unless I were possessed with a legion of spirits, 'tis  impossible to be made perspicuous by any utterance:  for sometimes he must take austere state, as for the  person of Galeatzo, the son of the Duke of Florence,  and possess his exterior presence with a formal majesty:  keep popularity in distance, and on the sudden fling  his honour so prodigally into a common arm, that he  may seem to give up his indiscretion to the mercy of  vulgar censure. Now as solemn as a traveller,[47] and as  grave as a Puritan's ruff;[48] with the same breath as  slight and scattered in his fashion as a--a--anything;  now as sweet and neat as a barber's casting-bottle;[49]  straight as slovenly as the yeasty breast of an ale-knight:  now lamenting, then chafing, straight laughing,  then----.                                                       140  _Feli._ What then?  _Ant._ Faith, I know not what; 't had been a right  part for Proteus or Gew. Ho! blind Gew[50] would ha'  done 't rarely, rarely.  _Feli._ I fear it is not possible to limn so many persons  in so small a tablet as the compass of our plays  afford.  _Ant._ Right! therefore I have heard that those persons,  as he and you, Feliche, that are but slightly drawn  in this comedy, should receive more exact accomplishment  in a second part; which, if this obtain gracious  acceptance, means to try his fortune.                           151  _Feli._ Peace, here comes the Prologue: clear the stage.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [35] We have an Induction before _What you Will_ and _The     Malcontent_. Ben Jonson was particularly fond of introducing     preliminary dialogues, which are usually so tedious that we are     fain to exclaim with Cordatus (in the Induction to _Every Man     out of his Humour_), "I would they would begin once; this     protraction is able to sour the best settled patience in the     theatre."     [36] _I.e._, the poverty of the theatrical company. It was     common for an actor to represent two characters (or more) in the     same play. For example, William Shurlock personated Maharbal and     Prusias in Nabbes' _Hannibal and Scipio_, 1635; and in the     same play, Hugh Clerke, besides taking the part of Syphax,     personated the Nuntius.     [37] Old eds. "shew'd."     [38] So ed. 1633.--The 4to gives "blinks."     [39] A piece of whalebone, steel, or wood worn down the front of     the stays to keep them straight.     [40] Rents, cracks.     [41] "Truss my hose" = tie the tagged laces of my breeches.     [42] Hurl violently.     [43] Old eds. "_Exeunt_ ANT. _and_     ALB."     [44] Common, worthless.--The use of "modern" in this sense is     frequently found, and was sanctioned by Shakespeare; but it did     not escape Ben Jonson's censure in _The Poetaster_, v. i.:--          "Alas! that were no _modern_ consequence          To have cothurnal buskins frightened hence."     [45] "The old cut" = the old fashion. So Nashe in the epistle     dedicatory prefixed to _Strange News of the Intercepting     Certain Letters_, 1593:--"You are amongst grave Doctors and     men of judgment in both laws every day. I pray ask them the     question in my absence whether such a man as I have described     this epistler to be ... that hath made many proper rhymes of the     _old cut_ in his days," &c.     [46] Old eds. "_Exit_ ALB."     [47] "Jaques in _As You Like It_, describing his own     melancholy, says it is extracted from many objects, and that the     contemplation of his travels often wraps him in a most humorous     sadness: on which Rosalind observes--'A traveller! by my faith     you have great reason to be sad!'"--_Dilke._     [48] The Puritans' short starched ruffs were constantly     ridiculed. See Middleton's _Works_, viii. 69.     [49] A bottle for sprinkling perfumes.     [50] Probably an actor who had gone blind; but I can find no     information about him.                           THE PROLOGUE.  The wreath of pleasure and delicious sweets,  Begirt the gentle front of this fair troop!  Select and most respected auditors,  For wit's sake do not dream of miracles.  Alas! we shall but falter, if you lay  The least sad weight of an unus?d hope  Upon our weakness; only we give up  The worthless present of slight idleness  To your authentic censure.

Rosicleer was the brother of the Knight of the Sun, and     he figures prominently in the group of romances published under     the _Mirror of Knighthood_ (7 pts., 1583-1601). He had an     excellent suit of armour, which proved very serviceable in his     combats with giants.     [83] Dilke, in 1814, says that featherbeds were still used to     protect the men from the fire of the enemy. As to the use of     cables I refer the reader to Sir William Monson's _Naval     Tracts_ (_Collection of Voyages and Travels_,     1704, iii. 358), where in the directions "How to preserve the men     in fighting" it is stated:--"I prefer the coiling of cables on     the deck, and keeping part of the men within them...; for the     soldiers are in and out speedily upon all sudden occasions to     succour any part of the ship, or to enter an enemy, without     trouble to the sailors in handling their sails or to the gunners     in playing their ordnance."     [84] A twisted band worn round the hat. In _Every Man out of     his Humour_ (1599), the "cable-hatband" is mentioned as a     novelty of the latest fashion:--"I had on a gold cable hat-band     _then new come up_."     [85] Ruff, falling-band.     [86] "So in _King Henry VIII._:--          'Let the music knock it.'"--_Dilke._     [87] A quick lively dance.     [88] "The exclamation was too fashionable in the time of Marston     for those who had nothing else to say; and is ridiculed by Ben     Jonson in the character of Orange in _Every Man out of his     Humour_, as 'O Lord, sir,' is by Shakespeare in _All's Well     that Ends Well_.

Now this titmouse, what she     scanted by nature, she doth replenish by art, as her boxes of red     and white daily can testify. But to come to George, who arrived     at the ordinary among other gallants, throws his cloak upon the     table, salutes the gentlemen, and presently calls for a cup of     canary. George had a pair of hose on, that for some offence durst     not to be seen in that hue they were first dyed in, but from his     first colour being a youthful green, his long age turned him into     a mournful black, and for his antiquity was in print. Which this     busybody perceiving, thought now to give it him to the quick; and     drawing near Master Peele, looking upon his breeches, 'By my     troth, sir,' quoth she, 'these are exceedingly well printed.' At     which word, George, being a little moved in his mind that his old     hose were called in question, answered, 'And by my faith,     mistress,' quoth George, 'your face is most damnably ill     painted.' 'How mean you, sir?' quoth she. 'Marry thus, mistress,'     quoth George, 'that if it were not for printing and painting, my     arse and your face would grow out of reparations.'"     [98] Old eds.

We therefore, by force of our  united league, forbid you to harbour him, or his blood:  but if you apprehend his person, we entreat you to send  him, or his head, to us.

From_ Venice: PIERO SFORZA.      24  _And._ My thoughts are fix'd in contemplation  Why this huge earth, this monstrous animal,  That eats her children, should not have eyes and ears.  Philosophy maintains that Nature's wise,  And forms no useless or unperfect thing.  Did Nature make the earth, or the earth Nature?                  30  For earthly dirt makes all things, makes the man,  Moulds me up honour; and, like a cunning Dutchman,  Paints me a puppet even with seeming breath,  And gives a sot appearance of a soul.  Go to, go to; thou liest, Philosophy.  Nature forms things unperfect, useless, vain.  Why made she not the earth with eyes and ears  That she might see desert, and hear men's plaints?  That when a soul is splitted, sunk with grief,  He might fall thus, upon the breast of earth,                    40                                  [_He throws himself on the ground._  Exclaiming thus: O thou all-bearing earth,  Which men do gape for, till thou cramm'st their mouths,  And chokest their throats with dust; O chaune[101] thy breast,  And let me sink into thee! Look who knocks;  Andrugio calls.--But O, she's deaf and blind:  A wretch but lean relief on earth can find.  _Lu._ Sweet lord, abandon passion, and disarm.  Since by the fortune of the tumbling sea,  We are roll'd up upon the Venice marsh,  Let's clip all fortune, lest more low'ring fate--                50  _And._ More low'ring fate! O Lucio, choke that breath.  Now I defy chance: Fortune's brow hath frown'd,  Even to the utmost wrinkle it can bend:  Her venom's spit. Alas, what country rests,  What son, what comfort that she can deprive?  Triumphs not Venice in my overthrow?  Gapes not my native country for my blood?  Lies not my son tomb'd in the swelling main?  And yet more low'ring fate! There's nothing left  Unto Andrugio, but Andrugio:                                     60  And that nor mischief, force, distress, nor hell can take.  Fortune my fortunes, not my mind, shall shake.  _Lu._ Spoke[102] like yourself; but give me leave, my Lord,  To wish your safety.

O, to have a husband with a mouth  continually smoking, with a bush of furze on the ridge  of his chin, ready still to flop into his foaming chaps;  ah, 'tis more than most intolerable.  _Pier._ Nay faith, sweet niece, I was mighty strong in  thought we should have shut up night with an old  comedy: the Prince of Florence[174] shall have Mellida,  and thou should'st have----.                                    152  _Ros._ Nobody, good sweet uncle. I tell you, sir, I  have thirty-nine servants, and my monkey that makes  the fortieth. Now I love all of them lightly for something,  but affect none of them seriously for anything.  One's a passionate fool, and he flatters me above belief;  the second's a testy ape, and he rails at me beyond  reason; the third's as grave as some censor, and he  strokes up his mustachios three times, and makes six  plots of set faces, before he speaks one wise word; the  fourth's as dry as the bur of an hartichoke; the fifth  paints, and hath always a good colour for what he  speaks; the sixth----.             164  _Pier._ Stay, stay, sweet niece, what makes you thus  suspect your gallants' worth?  _Ros._ O, when I see one wear a periwig, I dread his  hair; another wallow in a great slop,[175] I mistrust the  proportion of his thigh; and wears a ruffled boot,[176] I fear  the fashion of his leg. Thus, something in each thing, one  trick in everything makes me mistrust imperfection in all  parts; and there's the full point of my addiction.              172      _The cornets sound a senet. Enter_ GALEATZO, MATZAGENTE,                    _and_ BALURDO _in maskery_.  _Pier._ The room's too scant: boys, stand in there, close.  _Mel._ [_To_ GALEATZO.] In faith, fair sir, I am too sad to dance.  _Pier._ How's that, how's that? too sad? By heaven, dance,  And grace him too, or go to----, I say no more.  _Mel._ A burning glass, the word[177] _splendente Phoebo_?  It is too curious, I conceit it not.  _Gal._ Faith, I'll tell thee. I'll no longer burn,  Than you will shine and smile upon my love.                     180  For look ye, fairest, by your pure sweets,  I do not dote upon your excellence;  And faith, unless you shed your brightest beams  Of sunny favour and acceptive grace  Upon my tender love, I do not burn:  Marry, but shine, and I'll reflect your beams  With fervent ardour. Faith! I would be loath to flatter  thee, fair soul, because I love, not dote, court like thy  husband, which thy father swears to-morrow morn I  must be. This is all; and now from henceforth, trust  me, Mellida, I'll not speak one wise word to thee more.  _Mel._ I trust ye.                                              192  _Gal._ By my troth, I'll speak pure fool[178] to thee  now.  _Mel._ You will speak the liker yourself.  _Gal._ Good faith, I'll accept of the coxcomb, so you  will not refuse the bable.[179]  _Mel._ Nay, good sweet, keep them both; I am enamoured  of neither.  _Gal._ Go to, I must take you down for this. Lend  me your ear.                                                    200  _Ros._ A glow-worm? the word,--_Splendescit tant?m  tenebris_.  _Mat._ O, lady, the glow-worm figurates my valour,  which shineth brightest in most dark, dismal, and horrid  achievements.  _Ros._ Or rather, your glow-worm represents your wit,  which only seems to have fire in it, though indeed 'tis  but an _ignis fatuus_, and shines only in the dark dead  night of fools' admiration.  _Mat._ Lady, my wit hath spurs, if it were dispos'd to  ride you.                                                       211  _Ros._ Faith, sir, your wit's spurs have but walking  rowels; dull, blunt, they will not draw blood: the  gentlemen-ushers may admit them the presence, for any  wrong they can do to ladies.  _Bal._ Truly, I have strained a note above ela[180] for a  device: look you, 'tis a fair-ruled singing book; the  word, _Perfect, if it were prick'd_.  _Fla._ Though you are mask'd, I can guess who you  are by your wit. You are not the exquisite Balurdo,  the most rarely-shaped Balurdo.                                 221  _Bal._ Who, I? No, I am not Sir Jeffrey Balurdo. I  am not as well known by my wit as an alehouse by a  red lattice.[181] I am not worthy to love and be beloved  of Flavia.  _Fla._ I will not scorn to favour such good parts  As are applauded in your rarest self.       227  _Bal._ Truly, you speak wisely, and like a jantlewoman  of fourteen years of age. You know the stone called  _lapis_; the nearer it comes to the fire, the hotter it is:  and the bird, which the geometricians call _avis_, the  farther it is from the earth, the nearer it is to the  heaven; and love, the nigher it is to the flame, the  more remote (there's a word, remote!) the more remote  it is from the frost. Your wit is quick; a little thing  pleaseth a young lady, and a small favour contenteth  an old courtier; and so, sweet mistress, I truss my  codpiece point.                                                 238                         _Enter_ FELICHE.  _Pier._ What might import this flourish? Bring us word.  _Feli._ Stand away: here's such a company of flyboats,[182]  hulling[183] about this galleasse[184] of greatness, that there's  no boarding him.  Do you hear, yon thing call'd duke?  _Pier._ How now, blunt Feliche; what's the news?  _Feli._ Yonder's a knight, hath brought Andrugio's head,  And craves admittance to your chair of state.        _Cornets sound a senet. Enter_ ANDRUGIO _in armour_.  _Pier._ Conduct him with attendance sumptuous;  Sound all the pleasing instruments of joy;  Make triumph stand on tiptoe whilst we meet:  O sight most gracious, O revenge most sweet!                    250  _And. We vow, by the honour of our birth, to recompense  any man that bringeth Andrugio's head, with twenty thousand  double pistolets, and the endearing to our choicest  love._  _Pier._ We still with most unmoved resolve[185] confirm  Our large munificence, and here breathe  A sad and solemn protestation:  When I recall this vow, O, let our house  Be even commanded, stain'd, and trampled on,  As worthless rubbish of nobility.                               260  _And._ Then here [_raising his beaver_], Piero, is Andrugio's head,  Royally casqu?d in a helm of steel:  Give me thy love, and take it. My dauntless soul  Hath that unbounded vigour in his spirits  That it can bear more rank indignity,  With less impatience than thy canker'd hate  Can sting and venom his untainted worth  With the most vip'rous sound of malice. Strike!  O, let no glimpse of honour light thy thoughts;  If there be any heat of royal breath                            270  Creeping in thy veins, O stifle it;  Be still thyself, bloody and treacherous.  Fame not thy house with an admir?d act  Of princely pity. Piero, I am come  To soil thy house with an eternal blot  Of savage cruelty; strike, or bid me strike.  I pray my death; that thy ne'er-dying shame  Might live immortal to posterity.  Come, be a princely hangman, stop my breath.  O dread thou shame, no more than I dread death.                 280  _Pier._ We are amazed, our royal spirit's numb'd  In stiff astonish'd wonder at thy prowess.  Most mighty, valiant, and high-tow'ring heart,  We blush, and turn our hate upon ourselves,  For hating such an unpeer'd excellence.  I joy my state: him whom I loath'd before,  That now I honour, love, nay more, adore.                   [_The still flutes sound a mournful senet. Enter a                         funeral procession, followed by_ LUCIO.  But stay; what tragic spectacle appears!  Whose body bear you in that mournful hearse?  _Lu._ The breathless trunk of young Antonio.                    290  _Mel._ Antonio! ay me! my lord, my love! my----.  _And._ Sweet precious issue of most honour'd blood,  Rich hope, ripe virtue, O untimely loss!  Come hither, friend: prithee, do not weep.  Why, I am glad he's dead; he shall not see  His father's vanquish'd by his enemy,  Even in princely honour. Nay, prithee, speak!  How died the wretched boy?  _Lu._ My lord!  _And._ I hope he died yet like my son, i'faith.                 300  _Lu._ Alas, my lord!  _And._ He died unforced, I trust, and valiantly?  _Lu._ Poor gentleman, being----  _And._ Did his hand shake, or his eye look dull,  His thoughts reel fearful when he struck the stroke?  And if they did, I'll rend them out the hearse,  Rip up his cerecloth, mangle his bleak face,  That when he comes to heaven, the powers divine,  Shall ne'er take notice that he was my son:  I'll quite disclaim his birth. Nay, prithee, speak!             310  And 'twere not hooped with steel, my breast would break.  _Mel._ O that my spirit in a sigh could mount  Into the sphere where thy sweet soul doth rest!  _Pier._ O that my tears, bedewing thy wan cheek,  Could make new spirit sprout in thy cold blood!  _Bal._ Verily, he looks as pitifully as a poor John;[186]  as I am true knight, I could weep like a ston'd  horse.  _And._ Villain, 'tis thou hast murder?d my son!  Thy unrelenting spirit, thou black dog,      320  That took'st no passion[187] of his fatal love,  Hath forced him give his life untimely end.  _Pier._ O! that my life, her love, my dearest blood,  Would but redeem one minute of his breath!  _Ant._ [_rising_.] I seize that breath. Stand not amazed,     great states;  I rise from death that never lived till now.  Piero, keep thy vow, and I enjoy  More unexpress?d height of happiness  Than power of thought can reach; if not, lo, here  There stands my tomb, and here a pleasing stage.                330  Most-wish'd spectators of my tragedy,  To this end have I feign'd, that her fair eye,  For whom I lived, might bless me ere I die.  _Mel._ Can breath depaint[188] my unconceiv?d thoughts?  Can words describe my infinite delight  Of seeing thee, my lord Antonio?  O no; conceit, breath, passion, words, be dumb,  Whilst I instill the dew of my sweet bliss,  In the soft pressure of a melting kiss!  _Sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras._                                340  _Pier._ Fair son (now I'll be proud to call thee son),  Enjoy me thus: my very breast is thine;  Possess me freely, I am wholly thine.  _Ant._ Dear father----  _And._ Sweet son, sweet son, I can speak no more:  My joy's passion flows above the shore,  And chokes the current of my speech.  _Pier._ Young Florence prince, to you my lips must beg  For a remittance of your interest.  _Gal._ In your fair daughter? with all my thought.              350  So help me faith, the nak'd truth I'll unfold;  He that was never[189] hot will soon be cold.  _Pier._ No man else makes claim unto her?  _Mat._ The valiant speak truth in brief: no--  _Bal._ Truly, for Sir Jeffrey Balurdo, he disclaims to  have had anything in her.  _Pier._ Then here I give her to Antonio.  Royal, valiant, most respected prince,  Let's clip our hands, I'll thus observe my vow:  I promised twenty thousand double pistolets,                    360  With the endearing to my dearest love,  To him that brought thy head; thine be the gold,  To solemnise our houses' unity;  My love be thine, the all I have, be thine.  Fill us fresh wine, the form we'll take by this;  We'll drink a health, while they two sip a kiss.[190]  Now there remains no discord that can sound  Harsh accents to the ear of our accord:  So please you,[191] niece, to match.                            369  _Ros._ Troth, uncle, when my sweet-faced coz hath told  me how she likes the thing called wedlock, may be I'll  take a survey of the checkroll of my servants; and he  that hath the best parts of--I'll prick him down for my  husband.  _Bal._ For passion of love now, remember me to my  mistress, lady Rossaline, when she is pricking down the  good parts of her servants. As I am true knight, I grow  stiff; I shall carry it.  _Pier._ I will.  Sound Lydian wires, once make a pleasing note                   380  On nectar streams of your sweet airs to float.  _Ant._ Here ends the comic crosses of true love;  O! may the passage most successful prove!     [160] Cool.--To _keel the pot_ was to stir the contents     gently in order to keep them from boiling over.     [161] Motto.     [162] So ed. 1602.--Ed. 1633 "thou wilt."     [163] A familiar form of address.     [164] A sort of velvet.     [165] In _Every Man out of his Humour_, iv. 4, after Fastidious     Brisk has been describing the damage done to his finery in a     duel, Carlo observes--"I wonder he speaks not of his _wrought     shirt_."
