On Sophonisba'smarriage-night news is brought that the Carthaginian forces stationedat Utica have been defeated by the united armies of Scipio and Syphax.Massinissa is ordered by the senate to march without delay against theenemy; he loyally obeys the command, and takes leave of hisvirgin-wife. While he is serving Carthage in the field, theCarthaginian senators at home proceed to plot against his life. Theydetermine to gain Syphax to their side by giving him Sophonisba towife; and Gisco, a physician and skilful empoisoner, is sent to theCarthaginian camp to despatch Massinissa. Among the senators there isan honest old man, Gelosso, who disguises himself, follows Gisco tothe camp, and hands Massinissa a letter containing a disclosure of theplot. Massinissa has no sooner dismissed the empoisoner (whom hescorns to punish) than Jugurth, Massinissa's nephew, enters, toannounce that Syphax has been seen riding in the direction of Cirta,and that his horsemen are coming at a leisurely pace towards the campas if to fraternise with Massinissa's forces. By advice of Gelosso,who lays aside his disguise, Massinissa scatters the horsemen by asudden onslaught, and hastens to make a league with Scipio. MeanwhileSophonisba has been sent by the Carthaginian senators to the palace ofSyphax at Cirta. She escapes by a subterranean passage that led fromthe palace to a forest, but through the treachery of her attendant,Zanthia, falls again into the hands of Syphax.  In despair ofeffecting his purpose by persuasion, Syphax applies for help to apowerful enchantress, Erictho, who engages to force Sophonisba bymagic to his arms, on condition that he shall speak no word, and haveno lights burning, while he embraces her. On the appointed nightSyphax discovers to his horror that his embraces have been given toErictho. While he is cursing his fortunes, a messenger arrives toannounce that Scipio and Massinissa are advancing against Cirta. Hemarches out to meet them; the troops on either side withdraw, whileSyphax and Massinissa engage in single combat; Massinissa vanquisheshis opponent, but spares his life on receiving assurance thatSophonisba has not suffered outrage. Leaving his prisoner in Scipio'shands, Massinissa hastens to Cirta. He enters the palace with hisbeaver down, unrecognised by Sophonisba, who throws herself at hisfeet, and implores him to save her from falling into the hands of theRomans, or grant her instant death. Pledging his oath that he willprotect her, he doffs his helmet. The joyful reunion is presentlyinterrupted by the entrance of the Roman general, Lælius, who ordersMassinissa to deliver Sophonisba into Scipio's custody (Syphax havingrepresented to Scipio that Sophonisba would quickly induce Massinissato revolt from Rome). Lælius departs with Massinissa's assurance thatthe command shall be obeyed. Massinissa is distracted; he must eitherbreak the oath that he had pledged to Sophonisba, or he must befaithless in the allegiance that he had sworn to Rome. Sophonisba'sheroism rescues him from his dilemma. She declares her willingness todie; he infuses poison in a bowl of wine, and the dauntless womandrinks, speaking words of comfort to her husband as the poison coursesthrough her veins. The lifeless body, laid on a bier, is presented toScipio by Massinissa.                      _TO THE GENERAL READER._Know that I have not laboured in this poem to tie myself to relateanything as an historian, but to enlarge everything as a poet.

And since this torrent,  War's rage, admits no anchor--since the billow  Is risen so high we may not hull,[315] but yield  This ample state to stroke of speedy swords;  What you with sober haste have well decreed,  We'll put to sudden arms; no, not this night,  These dainties, these firstfruits of nuptials,  That well might give excuse for feeble lingerings,  Shall hinder Massinissa.

Virtue perforce is vice;  But he that may, yet holds, is manly wise.  Lo then, ye lords of Carthage, to your trust  I leave all Massinissa's treasure: by the oath  Of right good men stand to my fortune just:  Most hard it is for great hearts to mistrust.  _Car._ We vow by all high powers.  _Mass._ No, do not swear;  I was not born so small to doubt or fear.  _So._ Worthy, my lord----  _Mass._ Peace, my ears are steel;                               210  I must not hear thy much-enticing voice.  _So._ My Massinissa, Sophonisba speaks  Worthy thy wife: go with as high a hand  As worth can rear.  I will not stay my lord.  Fight for our country; vent thy youthful heat  In field, not beds: the fruit of honour, Fame,  Be rather gotten than the oft disgrace  Of hapless parents, children. Go, best man,  And make me proud to be a soldier's wife,  That values his renown above faint pleasures:                   220  Think every honour that doth grace thy sword  Trebles my love. By thee I have no lust  But of thy glory. Best lights of heaven with thee!  Like wonder, stand or fall; so, though thou die,  My fortunes may be wretched, but not I.  _Mass._ Wondrous creature! even fit for gods, not men:  Nature made all the rest of thy fair sex  As weak essays, to make thee a pattern  Of what can be in woman! Long farewell!  He's sure unconquer'd in whom thou dost dwell,                  230  Carthage Palladium.[316] See that glorious lamp--  Whose lifeful[317] presence giveth sudden flight  To fancies, fogs, fears, sleep, and slothful night--  Spreads day upon the world: march swift amain;--  Fame got with loss of breath is god-like gain!                    [_The Ladies draw the curtains about_ SOPHONISBA;                          _the rest accompany_ MASSINISSA _forth: the                          cornets and organs playing loud full music                          for the Act_.     [301] The maiden-girdle worn by unmarried women.

Whilst he fights abroad,  Let's gain back Syphax, making him our own,  By giving Sophonisba to his bed.                                 10  _Han._ Syphax is Massinissa's greater, and his force  Shall give more side to Carthage: as for's queen,  And her wise father, they love Carthage fate;  Profit and honesty are not one in state.  _Gel._ And what decrees our very virtuous Senate  Of worthy Massinissa, that now fights,  And (leaving wife and bed) bleeds in good arms  For right old Carthage?  _Car._ Thus 'tis thought fit:  Her father, Asdrubal, on sudden shall take in  Revolted Syphax; so with doubled strength,                       20  Before that Massinissa shall suspect,  Slaughter both Massinissa and his troops,  And likewise strike with his deep stratagem  A sudden weakness into Scipio's arms,  By drawing such a limb from the main body  Of his yet powerful army: which being done,  Dead Massinissa's kingdom we decree  To Sophonisba and great Asdrubal  For their consent; so this swift plot shall bring  Two crowns to her, make Asdrubal a king.                         30  _Gel._ So, first faith's breach, murder, adultery, theft!  _Car._ What else?  _Gel._ Nay, all is done, no mischief left.  _Car._ Pish!  Prosperous success gives blackest actions glory;  The means are unremember'd in most story.  _Gel._ Let me not say gods are not.  _Car._ This is fit:  Conquest by blood is not so sweet as wit:  For howsoe'er nice virtue censures[321] it,  He hath the grace of war that hath war's profit.  But Carthage, well advised that states come on                   40  With slow advice, quick execution,  Have here an engineer long bred for plots,  Call'd an impois'ner, who knows this sound excuse:  Th' only dew that makes men sprout in court is use.  Be't well or ill, his thrift is to be mute;  Such slaves must act commands, and not dispute.  Knowing foul deeds with danger do begin,  But with rewards do end: sin is no sin,  But in respects----  _Gel._ Politic lord, speak low: though Heaven bears  A face far from us, gods have most long ears;                    51  Jove has a hundred marble marble hands.  _Car._ O ay, in poetry or tragic scene!  _Gel._ I fear gods only know what poets mean.  _Car._ Yet hear me, I will speak close truth and cease:  Nothing in Nature is unserviceable,  No, not even inutility itself.  Is then for nought dishonesty in being?  And if it be sometimes of forcèd use,  Wherein more urgent than in saving nations?                      60  State shapes are solder'd up with base, nay faulty,  Yet necessary functions: some must lie,  Some must betray, some murder, and some all;  Each hath strong use, as poison in all purges:  Yet when some violent chance shall force a state  To break given faith, or plot some stratagems,  Princes ascribe that vile necessity  Unto Heaven's wrath. And sure, though't be no vice,  Yet 'tis bad chance: states must not stick too nice,  For Massinissa's death sense bids forgive:                       70  Beware t'offend great men, and let them live;  For 'tis of empire's body the main arm,--  He that will do no good shall do no harm.  You have my mind.  _Gel._ Although a stage-like passion, and weak heat,  Full of an empty wording, might suit age,  Know I'll speak strongly truth. Lords, ne'er mistrust,  That he who'll not betray a private man  For his country, will ne'er betray his country  For private men; then give Gelosso faith.                        80  If treachery in state be serviceable,  Let hangmen do it. I am bound to lose  My life, but not mine honour, for my country.  Our vows, our faith, our oaths, why they're ourselves,  And he that's faithless to his proper self  May be excus'd if he break faith with princes.  The gods assist just hearts, and states that trust  Plots before Providence are toss'd like dust.  For Massinissa (O, let me slack a little  Austere discourse and feel humanity!)                            90  Methinks I hear him cry, "O fight for Carthage!  Charge home! wounds smart not for that so just, so great,  So good a city." Methinks I see him yet  Leave his fair bride, even on his nuptial night,  To buckle on his arms for Carthage. Hark!  Yet, yet, I hear him cry,--"Ingratitude,  Vile stain of man, O ever be most far  From Massinissa's breast! Up, march amain;  Fame got by loss of breath is god-like gain!"  And see, by this he bleeds in doubtful[322] fight,              100  And cries "For Carthage!" whilst Carthage--Memory,  Forsake Gelosso! would I could not think,  Nor hear, nor be, when Carthage is  So infinitely vile! See, see! look here!  _Cornets. Enter two_ Ushers; SOPHONISBA, ZANTHIA, _and_ ARCATHIA;     HANNO, BYTHEAS, _and_ CARTHALON _present_ SOPHONISBA _with a     paper, which she having perused, after a short silence, speaks_.  _So._ Who speaks? What, mute? Fair plot! What? blush to break it?  How lewd to act when so shamed but to speak it.  Is this the Senate's firm decree?[323]  _Car._ It is.  _So._ Is this the Senate's firm decree?  _Car._ It is.  _So._ Hath Syphax entertained the stratagem?  _Car._ No doubt he hath or will.  _So._ My answer's thus,                                         110  What's safe to Carthage shall be sweet to us.[324]  _Car._ Right worthy.  _Han._ Royalest.  _Gel._ O very woman!  _So._ But 'tis not safe for Carthage to destroy.  Be most unjust, cunningly politic,  Your head's still under heaven. O trust to Fate:  Gods prosper more a just than crafty state;  'Tis less disgrace to have a pitied loss,  Than shameful victory.  _Gel._ O very angel!  _So._ We all have sworn good Massinissa faith;  Speech makes us men, and there's no other bond                  120  'Twixt man and man but words. O equal gods!  Make us once know the consequence of vows--  _Gel._ And we shall hate faith-breakers worse than man-eaters.  _So._ Ha, good Gelosso, is thy breath not here?  _Gel._ You do me wrong: as long as I can die,  Doubt you that old Gelosso can be vile?  States may afflict, tax, torture, but our minds  Are only sworn to Jove. I grieve, and yet am proud  That I alone am honest: high powers, ye know  Virtue is seldom seen with troops to go.                        130  _So._ Excellent man! Carthage and Rome shall fall  Before thy fame.--Our lords, know I the worst?  _Car._ The gods foresaw, 'tis fate we thus are forc'd.  _So._ Gods naught foresee, but see, for to their eyes  Naught is to come or past; nor are you vile  Because the gods foresee; for gods, not[325] we,  See as things are; things are not as[326] we see.  But since affected wisdom in us women  Is our sex' highest folly, I am silent;  I cannot speak less well, unless I were                         140  More void of goodness. Lords of Carthage, thus:  The air and earth of Carthage owes[327] my body;  It is their servant; what decree they of it?  _Car._ That you remove to Cirta, to the palace  Of well-form'd Syphax, who with longing eyes  Meets you: he that gives way to Fate is wise.  _So._ I go: what power can make me wretched? what evil  Is there in life to him that knows life's loss  To be no evil? show, show thy ugliest brow,  O most black chance; make me a wretched story:                  150  Without misfortune virtue hath no glory;  Opposèd trees makes tempests show their power,  And waves forced back by rocks makes Neptune tower,--  Tearless O see a miracle of life,  A maid, a widow, yet a hapless wife!                        [_Cornets._ SOPHONISBA, _accompanied with the                              Senators, departs; only_ GELOSSO _stays_.  _Gel._ A prodigy! let Nature run cross-legg'd,  Ops go upon his head, let Neptune burn,  Cold Saturn crack with heat, for now the world  Hath seen a woman!  Leap nimble lightning from Jove's ample shield,                 160  And make at length an end!

A second charge is given:  Then look, as when a falcon towers aloft,  Whole shoals of fowl and flocks of lesser birds                  70  Crouch fearfully, and dive; some among sedge,  Some creep in brakes: so Massinissa's sword,  Brandish'd aloft, toss'd 'bout his shining casque,  Made stoop whole squadrons; quick as thought he strikes,  Here hurls he darts, and there his rage-strong arm  Fights foot to foot; here cries he "strike! they sink!"  And then grim slaughter follows; for by this,  As men betray'd, they curse us, die, or fly, or both;  Six thousand fell at once.

I must confess  We not affect protesting feebleness,                             30  Entreats, faint blushings, timorous modesty;  We think our lover is but little man,  Who is so full of woman. Know, fair Prince,  Love's strongest arm's not rude; for we still prove,  Without some fury there's no ardent love.  We love our love's impatience of delay;  Our noble[340] sex was only born t'obey,  To him that dares command.  _Sy._ Why, this is well;  Th' excuse is good: wipe thy fair eyes, our Queen,  Make proud thy head; now feel more friendly strength  Of thy lord's arm: come, touch my rougher skin                   41  With thy soft lip.

Nature at home begins;  She, whose integrity herself hurts, sins.  For Massinissa, he was good, and so;  But he is dead, or worse, distress'd, or more  Than dead, or much distress'd. O sad, poor,--  Who ever held such friends? no, let him go;  Such faith is praised, then laugh'd at; for still know  Those are the living women that reduce                           80  All that they touch unto their ease and use,  Knowing that wedlock, virtue, or good names,  Are courses and varieties of reason,  To use or leave, as they advantage them,  And absolute within themselves reposed,  Only to greatness ope, to all else closed.  Weak sanguine fools are to their own good nice;  Before I held you virtuous, but now wise.  _So._ Zanthia, victorious Massinissa lives,  My Massinissa lives.

Carthage first gave me life;  Her ground gave food, her air first lent me breath:  The earth was made for men, not men for earth.  Scipio, I do not thank the gods for life,  Much less vile men, or earth; know, best of lords,  It is a happy being, breath well famed,  For which Jove sees these thus.[349] Men, be not fool'd  With piety to place, tradition's fear;                           10  A just man's country Jove makes everywhere.  _Sci._ Well urgeth Massinissa; but to leave  A city so ingrate, so faithless, so more vile  Than civil speech can name, fear not; such vice  To scourge is Heaven's grateful sacrifice.  Thus all confess, first they have broke a faith  To the[e] most due, so just to be observed,  That barbarousness itself may well blush at them:  Where is thy passion? They have shared thy crown,  The proper right of birth, contrived thy death:                  20  Where is thy passion? Given thy beauteous spouse  To thy most hated rival. Statue, not man!  And last, thy friend Gelosso (man worth gods)  With tortures have they rent to death.  _Mass_. O Gelosso!  For thee full eyes----  _Sci._ No passion for the rest?  _Mass._ O Scipio,  My grief for him may be expressed by tears,  But for the rest, silence, and secret anguish  Shall waste--shall waste! Scipio, he that can weep,  Grieves not, like me, private deep inward drops                  30  Of blood. My heart! for god's right give me leave  To be a short time man.  _Sci._ Stay, prince.  _Mass._ I cease;  Forgive if I forget thy presence. Scipio,  Thy face makes Massinissa more than man,  And here before your steady power a vow  As firm as fate I make: when I desist  To be commanded by thy virtue, Scipio,  Or fall from friend of Rome,[350] revenging gods  Afflict me with[351] your torture. I have given  Of passion and of faith, my heart.  _Sci._ To counsel then;                                          40  Grief fits weak hearts, revenging virtue men.  Thus I think fit, before that Syphax know  How deeply Carthage sinks, let's beat swift march  Up even to Cirta, and whilst Syphax snores  With his, late thine----  _Mass._ With mine! no, Scipio;  Libya hath poison, asps, knives, and too much earth  To make one grave. With mine! Not; she can die.  Scipio, with mine!
