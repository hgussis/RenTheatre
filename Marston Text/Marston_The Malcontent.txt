Hisidentity is known only to his faithful friend Celso. A craftycourtier, Mendoza, who had assisted in dethroning Altofronto, hasadulterous intercourse with Pietro's wife, Aurelia. Malevole exposesthe intrigue to Pietro; but meanwhile Aurelia, induced by an oldprocuress, Maquerelle, to believe that her lover is faithless,discards Mendoza and engages in an intrigue with another courtier,Ferneze. Pietro, sword in hand, seeks Mendoza, who makes passionateprotestations of his own innocence, and declares that the guiltyperson is Ferneze. On that very night Ferneze has an appointment withthe Duchess; and it is agreed that Pietro with some of the guard shallbreak into the Duchess' chamber, while Mendoza waits with his drawnsword at the door. Ferneze is to be allowed to escape from thechamber, only to be received on the sword of Mendoza, who is then tostand over the body and pretend that he is guarding it from assault.Thus Mendoza will not only serve Pietro, but by his seeming generositytowards Ferneze will earn the gratitude of Aurelia, who, should sheattempt to take vengeance on her husband, will not fail to makeMendoza acquainted with her plots, which he will incontinently revealto Pietro. At the hour appointed, Pietro and the guard invade theDuchess' chamber; the flying gallant is stabbed by Mendoza and leftfor dead (though he afterwards recovers from the wound); Aureliareceives Mendoza again into favour, and practises with him to murderPietro. Mendoza, selecting a time when Pietro had gone a-hunting,bribes Malevole to commit the murder. Malevole undertakes to killPietro by stealth in the forest, fling his body into the sea, and thenreturn to announce that Pietro, distracted by grief at the dishonourbrought on him by his wife, has made away with himself by leaping intothe sea from a high rock. To the forest goes Malevole, finds Pietro,and exposes to him the plot; presently Celso appears bringing ahermit's weeds, into which Pietro shifts. They return to the court,and the pretended hermit describes with much detail how he saw Pietroperish, the narrative being substantiated by Malevole. Mendoza isproclaimed Duke, and his first act is to pronounce a sentence ofperpetual banishment on Aurelia. He then commissions Malevole to bringfrom the citadel (where she is confined) the wife of the banishedAltofronto, the virtuous Maria, whom he intends to make his Duchess.His brain is now exercised to procure the destruction of the supposedmurderers. Malevole is instructed to poison the hermit at a suppergiven in the citadel, and the hermit on the same occasion is to poisonMalevole; thus two awkward agents will be removed, and the suspicionwill fall on Maria, whose fears will drive her to submit to Mendoza.Pietro informs Malevole of the instructions he had received, andlearns that similar instructions have been given to Malevole. Weigheddown with sorrow at his own dishonour, and disgusted with Mendoza'svillainy, Pietro declares his determination to dedicate his life toreligious solitude, and make it his one care that the banishedAltofronto shall be restored to the dukedom. Thereupon Malevole putsoff his disguise, and Pietro beholds the banished Duke. Ferneze nowapproaches with Celso, and receives pardon from Pietro, who hadsupposed him to be dead. The four then take counsel how they shalldepose Mendoza. Malevole goes to the usurper and announces that he haspoisoned the hermit; he then produces a box of poison, which, hedeclares, will cause instant death on being opened and held to thenostrils. Mendoza opens the box and tries its effects on Malevole, whofeigns to fall dead. A masque is ordered by Mendoza to be given inhonour of Maria, who shows herself indifferent both to the tyrant'sflatteries and threats. At the entertainment Malevole, Pietro, andFerneze appear masked; Malevole chooses Maria as his partner in thedance, and Pietro is matched with Aurelia, who has deeply repented ofher misconduct. At the close of the dance, during which Malevole andPietro have discovered themselves to their partners, the maskersenviron Mendoza, level their pistols at his head, and unmask.Altofronto is received with joyful acclamations by the assembledcompany, and Mendoza--whose life the restored Duke disdains totake--is banished with shameful ignominy.                      BENIAMINO[324] JONSONIO,                               POETｮ                           ELEGANTISSIMO,                            GRAVISSIMO,                               AMICO                     SVO, CANDIDO ET CORDATO,                         IOHANNES MARSTON,                         MVSARVM ALVMNVS,                     ASPERAM HANC SVAM THALIAM                               D.

"_Beniamini._"                          TO THE READER.I am an ill orator; and, in truth, use to indite more honestly thaneloquently, for it is my custom to speak as I think, and write as Ispeak.In plainness, therefore, understand, that in some things I havewillingly erred, as in supposing a Duke of Genoa, and in taking namesdifferent from that city's families: for which some may wittily accuseme; but my defence shall be as honest as many reproofs unto me havebeen most malicious. Since, I heartily protest, it was my care towrite so far from reasonable offence, that even strangers, in whosestate I laid my scene, should not from thence draw any disgrace toany, dead or living. Yet, in despite of my endeavours, I understandsome have been most unadvisedly over-cunning in misinterpreting me,and with subtlety as deep as hell have maliciously spread ill rumours,which, springing from themselves, might to themselves have heavilyreturned. Surely I desire to satisfy every firm spirit, who, in allhis actions, proposeth to himself no more ends than God and virtue do,whose intentions are always simple: to such I protest that, with myfree understanding, I have not glanced at disgrace of any, but ofthose whose unquiet studies labour innovation, contempt of holypolicy, reverend, comely superiority, and established unity: for therest of my supposed tartness, I fear not but unto every worthy mind itwill be approved so general and honest as may modestly pass with thefreedom of a satire. I would fain leave the paper; only one thingafflicts me, to think that scenes, invented merely to be spoken,should be enforcively published to be read, and that the least hurt Ican receive is to do myself the wrong. But, since others otherwisewould do me more, the least inconvenience is to be accepted. I havemyself, therefore, set forth this comedy; but so, that my enforcedabsence must much rely upon the printer's discretion: but I shallentreat slight errors in orthography may be as slightly over-passed,and that the unhandsome shape which this trifle in reading presents,may be pardoned for the pleasure it once afforded you when it waspresented with the soul of lively action.            _Sine aliqua dementia nullus Phoebus._[325]     [325] For this motto ed. 1. gives "_Me mea sequentur fata._"                        THE INDUCTION[326]                                 TO            THE MALCONTENT, AND THE ADDITIONS ACTED BY                  THE KING'S MAJESTY'S SERVANTS.                     WRITTEN BY JOHN WEBSTER.   _Enter_ W. SLY,[327] _a_ Tire-man _following him with a stool_.  _Tire-man._ Sir, the gentlemen will be angry if you sit  here.  _Sly._ Why, we may sit upon the stage at the private  house.[328] Thou dost not take me for a country gentleman,  dost? dost think I fear hissing?[329] I'll hold my  life thou tookest me for one of the players.  _Tire-man._ No, sir.  _Sly._ By God's slid, if you had, I would have given you  but sixpence[330] for your stool. Let them that have stale  suits sit in the galleries. Hiss at me! He that will be  laughed out of a tavern or an ordinary, shall seldom feed  well, or be drunk in good company.--Where's Harry  Condell, Dick Burbadge, and William Sly? Let me  speak with some of them.                                         14  _Tire-man._ An't please you to go in, sir, you may.  _Sly._ I tell you, no: I am one that hath seen this play  often, and can give them intelligence for their action: I  have most of the jests here in my table-book.                       _Enter_ SINKLO.[331]  _Sinklo._ Save you, coz!  _Sly._ O, cousin, come, you shall sit between my legs  here.                                                            21  _Sinklo._ No, indeed, cousin: the audience then will  take me for a viol-de-gambo, and think that you play  upon me.  _Sly._ Nay, rather that I work upon you, coz.  _Sinklo._ We stayed for you at supper last night at my  cousin Honeymoon's, the woollen-draper. After supper  we drew cuts for a score of apricocks, the longest cut  still to draw an apricock: by this light, 'twas Mistress  Frank Honeymoon's fortune still to have the longest  cut: I did measure for the women.--What be these,  coz?                                                             32       _Enter_ D. BURBADGE,[332] H. CONDELL, _and_ J. LOWIN.  _Sly._ The players.--God save you!  _Burbadge._ You are very welcome.  _Sly._ I pray you, know this gentleman, my cousin;  'tis Master Doomsday's son, the usurer.  _Condell._ I beseech you, sir, be covered.  _Sly._ No,[333] in good faith, for mine ease: look you, my  hat's the handle to this fan: God's so, what a beast  was I, I did not leave my feather at home! Well,  but I'll take an order with you.                                 41                                   [_Puts his feather in his pocket._  _Burbadge._ Why do you conceal your feather, sir?  _Sly._ Why, do you think I'll have jests broken upon  me in the play, to be laughed at? this play hath beaten  all your gallants out of the feathers: Blackfriars hath  almost spoiled Blackfriars for feathers.[334]  _Sinklo._ God's so, I thought 'twas for somewhat our  gentlewomen at home counselled me to wear my feather  to the play: yet I am loth to spoil it.  _Sly._ Why, coz?                                                 50  _Sinklo._ Because I got it in the tilt-yard; there was a  herald broke my pate for taking it up: but I have worn  it up and down the Strand, and met him forty times  since, and yet he dares not challenge it.  _Sly._ Do you hear, sir? this play is a bitter play.  _Condell._ Why, sir, 'tis neither satire nor moral, but the  mean passage of a history: yet there are a sort of discontented  creatures that bear a stingless envy to great  ones, and these will wrest the doings of any man to their  base, malicious appliment; but should their interpretation  come to the test, like your marmoset, they presently  turn their teeth to their tail and eat it.                       62  _Sly._ I will not go so far with you; but I say, any  man that hath wit may censure,[335] if he sit in the twelve-penny  room;[336] and I say again, the play is bitter.  _Burbadge._ Sir, you are like a patron that, presenting  a poor scholar to a benefice, enjoins him not to rail  against anything that stands within compass of his  patron's folly. Why should not we enjoy the ancient  freedom of poesy? Shall we protest to the ladies that  their painting makes them angels? or to my young  gallant that his expenses in the brothel shall gain him  reputation? No, sir, such vices as stand not accountable  to law should be cured as men heal tetters, by casting  ink upon them. Would you be satisfied in anything  else, sir?                                                       76  _Sly._ Ay, marry, would I: I would know how you  came by this play?  _Condell._ Faith, sir, the book was lost; and because  'twas pity so good a play should be lost, we found it,  and play it.                                                 81  _Sly._ I wonder you would play it, another company  having interest in it.  _Condell._ Why not Malevole in folio with us, as Jeronimo  in decimo-sexto[337] with them? They taught us a  name for our play; we call it _One for another_.  _Sly._ What are your additions?  _Burbadge._ Sooth, not greatly needful; only as your  salad to your great feast, to entertain a little more time,  and to abridge the not-received custom of music in our  theatre. I must leave you, sir.                                                             [_Exit._  _Sinklo._ Doth he play the Malcontent.                           92  _Condell._ Yes, sir.  _Sinklo._ I durst lay four of mine ears the play is not so  well acted as it hath been.  _Condell._ O, no, sir, nothing _ad Parmenonis suem_.[338]  _Lowin._ Have you lost your ears, sir, that you are so  prodigal of laying them?  _Sinklo._ Why did you ask that, friend?  _Lowin._ Marry, sir, because I have heard of a fellow  would offer to lay a hundred-pound wager that was not  worth five baubees:[339] and in this kind you might venture  four of your elbows; yet God defend[340] your coat should  have so many!                                                   104  _Sinklo._ Nay, truly, I am no great censurer; and yet I  might have been one of the college of critics once. My  cousin here hath an excellent memory indeed, sir.  _Sly._ Who, I? I'll tell you a strange thing of myself;  and I can tell you, for one that never studied the art of  memory, 'tis very strange too.                                  110  _Condell._ What's that, sir?  _Sly._ Why, I'll lay a hundred pound, I'll walk but once  down by the Goldsmiths' Row in Cheap, take notice of  the signs, and tell you them with a breath instantly.  _Lowin._ 'Tis very strange.  _Sly._ They begin as the world did, with Adam and  Eve. There's in all just five and fifty.[341] I do use to  meditate much when I come to plays too. What do  you think might come into a man's head now, seeing all  this company?                                                   120  _Condell._ I know not, sir.  _Sly._ I have an excellent thought. If some fifty of the  Grecians that were crammed in the horse'-belly had  eaten garlic, do you not think the Trojans might have  smelt out their knavery?  _Condell._ Very likely.  _Sly._ By God, I would they[342] had, for I love Hector  horribly.  _Sinklo._ O, but, coz, coz!  "Great[343] Alexander, when he came to the tomb of Achilles,  Spake with a big loud voice, O thou thrice bless重 and happy!"  131  _Sly._ Alexander was an ass to speak so well of a filthy  cullion.[344]  _Lowin._ Good sir, will you leave the stage? I'll help  you to a private room.[345]  _Sly._ Come, coz, let's take some tobacco.[346]--Have you  never a prologue?  _Lowin._ Not any, sir.  _Sly._ Let me see, I will make one extempore.               [_Come[347] to them, and fencing of a congey with arms                    and legs, be round with them._  Gentlemen,[348] I could wish for the women's sakes you  had all soft cushions; and, gentlewomen, I could wish  that for the men's sakes you had all more easy standings.  What would they wish more but the play now? and  that they shall have instantly.                                 144                                                           [_Exeunt._     [326] The Induction was added in ed. 2.     [327] For an account of William Sly and the other actors     introduced in the Induction, see Collier's _Memoirs of the     Principal Actors in the Plays of Shakespeare_.     [328] _The Malcontent_ had been acted at the Blackfriars Theatre,     a private theatre. It was afterwards acted at the Globe, a public     theatre.     [329] It was a common practice for gallants to sit on the stage;     but when a coxcomb obstructed the view by planting himself in a     prominent position, the audience naturally took offence. Dekker,     in the chapter of the _Gull's Horn-Book_, describing "how a     gallant should behave himself at a play-house," writes:--"But on     the very rushes where the comedy is to dance, yea, and under the     state of Cambyses himself, must our feathered estridge, like a     piece of ordnance, be planted valiantly (because impudently),     _beating down the mews and hisses of the opposed rascality_."     [330] Sixpence, as we learn from the _Gull's Horn-Book_,     Induction to _Cynthia's Revels_, &c., was the usual charge for     the loan of a stool. Francis Lenton in his _Young Gallant's     Whirligig_ tells us of an "expensive fool" who was ready to "pay     an angel for a paltry stool." It was not uncommon to pay a     shilling for the convenience.     [331] Dr. Karl Elze in his _Notes on the Elizabethan Dramatists_     (2nd. ser., pp. 160-4) indulges in some speculations about this     actor.     [332] From _A Funeral Elegy_ on Burbadge, first printed by     Collier, we learn that the great actor took the part of Malevole     in _The Malcontent_:--               "Vindex is gone, and what a loss was he!                Frankford, Brachiano, and Malevole."     The elegy is in the main unquestionably genuine.     [333] "A quotation from the part of Osrick in _Hamlet_. Sly might     have been the original performer of that character."--_Steevens._     [334] The meaning is that in _The Malcontent_, which had been     originally acted at Blackfriars Theatre, the practice of wearing     feathers had been so ridiculed that the feather-makers of     Blackfriars had suffered injury in their business. In v. 4 occurs     the passage in which the use of feathers is ridiculed:--"For as     now-a-days no courtier but has his mistress, no captain but has     his cockatrice, no cuckold but has his horns, and _no fool but     has his feather._" &c. Blackfriars was noted as being the     residence of Puritans, many of whom followed the trade of     feather-makers. There is some amusing ridicule of the Puritan     feather-makers in Ben Jonson's _Bartholomew Fair_, Randolph's     _Muses' Looking-Glass_, &c.     [335] Judge.     [336] Box.     [337] The expression "in decimo sexto" is used in reference to     the company of the Children of the Chapel, acting at Blackfriars.     Cf. Middleton's _Father Hubburd's Tales_ (_Works_, ed. Bullen,     viii. 64):--"But for fear I interrupt this _small actor in less     than decimo sexto_, "&c. The Children's Company at the     Blackfriars seems to have appropriated Jeronimo, _i.e._, _The     Spanish Tragedy_, in which the King's Company at the Globe had an     interest; whereupon the King's Company retaliated by acting     Malevole, _i.e. The Malcontent_. The expression "Malevole _in     folio_" means "_The Malcontent_ acted by _men-actors_."--Dyce did     not understand the passage.     [338] A proverbial saying. "L. S." in the Shakespeare Society's     _Papers_, ii. 85 (1847), quotes from Plutarch's Symposium, v.     1:--"For upon what other account should men be moved to admire     _Parmeno's sow_ so much as to pass it into a proverb? Yet 'tis     reported that Parmeno, being very famous for imitating the     grunting of a pig, some endeavoured to rival and outdo him. And     when the hearers, being prejudiced, cried out, 'Very well,     indeed, but nothing comparable to Parmeno's sow,' one took a pig     under his arm and came upon the stage; and when, tho' they heard     the very pig, they still continued, 'This is nothing comparable     to Parmeno's sow,' he threw his pig amongst them to show that     they judged according to opinion and not truth" (Creech's     translation). Phｾdrus has a fable on the subject.     [339] Halfpennies.     [340] Forbid.     [341] "This is a pleasant exaggeration on the part of Sly. There     were in all, as Stow tells, 'ten fair dwelling-houses and     fourteen shops.' See 'Goldsmiths' Row' in _Handbook of London_,     ed. 1850.--_P.

His appetite is unsatiable  as the grave; as far from any content as from heaven:  his highest delight is to procure others' vexation, and  therein he thinks he truly serves heaven; for 'tis his  position, whosoever in this earth can be contented is a  slave and damned; therefore does he afflict all in that  to which they are most affected. The elements struggle  within him; his own soul is at variance within herself;[354]  his speech is halter-worthy at all hours. I like him,  faith: he gives good intelligence to my spirit, makes me  understand those weaknesses which others' flattery  palliates.--Hark! they sing. [_A song._] See, he comes.  Now shall you hear the extremity of a malcontent: he is  as free as air; he blows over every man.                         42                     _Enter_ MALEVOLE _below_.  And, sir, whence come you now?  _Mal._ From the public place of much dissimulation,  the church.[355]  _Pietro._ What didst there?  _Mal._ Talk with a usurer; take up at interest.  _Pietro._ I wonder what religion thou art of?[356]  _Mal._ Of a soldier's religion.  _Pietro._ And what dost thou[357] think makes most infidels  now?                                                             51  _Mal._ Sects, sects. I have seen seeming piety change  her robe so oft, that sure none but some arch-devil can  shape her a new[358] petticoat.  _Pietro._ O, a religious policy.  _Mal._ But, damnation on a politic religion! I am  weary: would I were one of the duke's hounds now![359]  _Pietro._ But what's the common news abroad, Malevole?  thou doggest rumour still.                                       59  _Mal._ Common news! why, common words are, God  save ye, Fare ye well; common actions, flattery and  cozenage; common things, women and cuckolds.--And  how does my little Ferrard? Ah, ye lecherous animal!--my  little ferret, he goes sucking up and down the palace  into every hen's nest, like a weasel:--and to what dost  thou addict thy time to now more than to those antique  painted drabs that are still effected of young  courtiers,--flattery, pride, and venery?  _Fer._ I study languages. Who dost think to be the  best linguist of our age?                                        70  _Mal._ Phew! the devil: let him possess thee; he'll  teach thee to speak all languages most readily and  strangely;[360] and great reason, marry, he's travelled greatly  i' the world, and is everywhere.  _Fer._ Save i' the court.  _Mal._ Ay, save i' the court.--[_To_ BILIOSO.] And how  does my old muckhill, overspread with fresh snow? thou  half a man, half a goat, all a beast! how does thy young  wife, old huddle?[361]  _Bil._ Out, you improvident rascal!                              80  _Mal._ Do, kick, thou hugely-horned old duke's ox,  good Master Make-pleas.  _Pietro._ How dost thou live nowadays, Malevole?  _Mal._ Why, like the knight Sir Patrick Penlohans,[362]  with killing o' spiders for my lady's monkey.[363]  _Pietro._ How dost spend the night? I hear thou never  sleepest.  _Mal._ O, no; but dream the most fantastical! O heaven!  O fubbery, fubbery!  _Pietro._ Dream! what dreamest?                                  90  _Mal._ Why, methinks I see that signior pawn his footcloth,[364]  that metreza[365] her plate: this madam takes physic,  that t'other monsieur may minister to her: here is a  pander jewelled; there is[366] a fellow in shift of satin this  day, that could not shift a shirt t'other night: here a Paris  supports that Helen; there's a Lady Guinever bears up  that Sir Lancelot: dreams, dreams, visions, fantasies,  chimeras, imaginations, tricks, conceits!--[_To_ PREPASSO.]  Sir Tristram Trimtram, come aloft,[367] Jack-an-apes, with a  whim-wham: here's a knight of the land of Catito shall  play at trap with any page in Europe; do the sword-dance  with any morris-dancer in Christendom; ride at  the ring[368] till the fin[369] of his eyes look as blue as the  welkin; and run the wildgoose-chase even with Pompey  the Huge.[370]                                                  105  _Pietro._ You run!  _Mal._ To the devil.--Now, signior Guerrino, that thou  from a most pitied prisoner shouldst grow a most loathed  flatterer!--Alas, poor Celso, thy star's oppressed: thou  art an honest lord: 'tis pity.                                  110  _Equato._ Is't pity?  _Mal._ Ay, marry is't, philosophical Equato; and 'tis  pity that thou, being so excellent a scholar by art, should  be so ridiculous a fool by nature.--I have a thing to tell  you, duke: bid 'em avaunt, bid 'em avaunt.  _Pietro._ Leave us, leave us.                          [_Exeunt all except_ PIETRO _and_ MALEVOLE.  Now, sir, what is't?  _Mal._ Duke, thou art a becco,[371] a cornuto.  _Pietro._ How!  _Mal._ Thou art a cuckold.                                      120  _Pietro._ Speak, unshale[372] him quick.  _Mal._ With most tumbler-like nimbleness.  _Pietro._ Who? by whom? I burst with desire.  _Mal._ Mendoza is the man makes thee a horned beast;  duke, 'tis Mendoza cornutes thee.  _Pietro._ What conformance? relate; short, short.  _Mal._ As a lawyer's beard.  There is an old crone in the court, her name is Maquerelle,  She is my mistress, sooth to say, and she doth ever tell me.  Blirt o' rhyme, blirt o' rhyme! Maquerelle is a cunning  bawd; I am an honest villain; thy wife is a close drab;  and thou art a notorious cuckold. Farewell, duke.               132  _Pietro._ Stay, stay.  _Mal._ Dull, dull duke, can lazy patience make lame  revenge? O God, for a woman to make a man that  which God never created, never made!  _Pietro._ What did God never make?  _Mal._ A cuckold: to be made a thing that's hoodwinked  with kindness, whilst every rascal fillips his  brows; to have a coxcomb with egregious horns pinned  to a lord's back, every page sporting himself with delightful  laughter, whilst he must be the last must know it:  pistols and poniards! pistols and poniards!                     143  _Pietro._ Death and damnation!  _Mal._ Lightning and thunder!  _Pietro._ Vengeance and torture!  _Mal._ Catso![373]  _Pietro._ O, revenge!  _Mal._[374] Nay, to select among ten thousand fairs  A lady far inferior to the most,  In fair proportion both of limb and soul;  To take her from austerer check of parents,  To make her his by most devoutful rites,                        150  Make her commandress of a better essence  Than is the gorgeous world, even of a man;  To hug her with as rais'd an appetite  As usurers do their delv'd-up treasury  (Thinking none tells it but his private self);  To meet her spirit in a nimble kiss,  Distilling panting ardour to her heart;  True to her sheets, nay, diets strong his blood,  To give her height of hymeneal sweets,----  _Pietro._ O God!                                                160  _Mal._ Whilst she lisps, and gives him some     court-_quelquechose_,[375]  Made only to provoke, not satiate:  And yet even then the thaw of her delight  Flows from lewd heat of apprehension,  Only from strange imagination's rankness,  That forms the adulterer's presence in her soul,  And makes her think she clips the foul knave's loins.  _Pietro._ Affliction to my blood's root!  _Mal._ Nay, think, but think what may proceed of this;  Adultery is often the mother of incest.                         170  _Pietro._ Incest!  _Mal._ Yes, incest: mark:--Mendoza of his wife begets  perchance a daughter: Mendoza dies; his son marries  this daughter: say you? nay, 'tis frequent, not only  probable, but no question often acted, whilst ignorance,  fearless ignorance, clasps his own seed.  _Pietro._ Hideous imagination!  _Mal._ Adultery? why, next to the sin of simony, 'tis  the most horrid transgression under the cope of salvation.      180  _Pietro._ Next to simony!  _Mal._ Ay, next to simony, in which our men in next  age shall not sin.  _Pietro._ Not sin! why?  _Mal._ Because (thanks to some churchmen) our age  will leave them nothing to sin with. But adultery, O  dulness! should show[376] exemplary punishment, that intemperate  bloods may freeze but to think it. I would  damn him and all his generation: my own hands should  do it; ha, I would not trust heaven with my vengeance:  --anything.                                                     191  _Pietro._ Anything, anything, Malevole: thou shalt see  instantly what temper my spirit holds. Farewell; remember  I forget thee not; farewell.                                                       [_Exit_ PIETRO.  _Mal._[377] Farewell.  Lean thoughtfulness, a sallow meditation,  Suck thy veins dry, distemperance rob thy sleep!  The heart's disquiet is revenge most deep:  He that gets blood, the life of flesh but spills,  But he that breaks heart's peace, the dear soul kills.          200  Well, this disguise doth yet afford me that  Which kings do seldom hear, or great men use,--  Free speech: and though my state's usurp'd,  Yet this affected strain gives me a tongue  As fetterless as in an emperor's.  I may speak foolishly, ay, knavishly,  Always carelessly, yet no one thinks it fashion  To poise my breath; for he that laughs and strikes  Is lightly felt, or seldom struck again.  Duke, I'll torment thee now; my just revenge                    210  From thee than crown a richer gem shall part:  Beneath God, naught's so dear as a calm heart.                         _Re-enter_ CELSO.  _Celso._ My honour'd lord,--  _Mal._ Peace, speak low, peace!

O, that I had been gelded! I should then have  been a fat fool for a chamber, a squeaking fool for a  tavern, and a private fool for all the ladies.  _Mal._ You are in good case since you came to court,  fool: what, guarded, guarded![399]                                9  _Pass._ Yes, faith, even as footmen and bawds wear  velvet, not for an ornament of honour, but for a badge  of drudgery; for, now the duke is discontented, I am  fain to fool him asleep every night.  _Mal._ What are his griefs?  _Pass._ He hath sore eyes.  _Mal._ I never observed so much.  _Pass._ Horrible sore eyes; and so hath every cuckold,  for the roots of the horns spring in the eyeballs, and  that's the reason the horn of a cuckold is as tender as  his eye, or as that growing in the woman's forehead twelve  years since,[400] that could not endure to be touched. The  duke hangs down his head like a columbine.                       22  _Mal._ Passarello, why do great men beg fools?[401]  _Pass._ As the Welshman stole rushes when there was  nothing else to filch; only to keep begging in fashion.  _Mal._ Pooh, thou givest no good reason; thou speakest  like a fool.  _Pass._ Faith, I utter small fragments, as your knight  courts your city widow with jingling[402] of his gilt spurs,  advancing his bush-coloured beard,[403] and taking tobacco:  this is all the mirror of their knightly complements.[404] Nay,  I shall talk when my tongue is a-going once; 'tis like a  citizen on horseback, evermore in a false gallop.                33  _Mal._ And how doth Maquerelle fare nowadays?  _Pass._ Faith, I was wont to salute her as our English  women are at their first landing in Flushing;[405] I would  call her whore: but now that antiquity leaves her as an  old piece of plastic[406] to work by, I only ask her how her  rotten teeth fare every morning, and so leave her. She  was the first that ever invented perfumed smocks for the  gentlewomen, and woollen shoes, for fear of creaking  for the visitant. She were an excellent lady, but that  her face peeleth like Muscovy glass.[407]                        43  _Mal._ And how doth thy old lord, that hath wit enough  to be a flatterer, and conscience enough to be a knave?  _Pass._ O, excellent: he keeps beside me fifteen jesters,  to instruct him in the art of fooling, and utters their jests  in private to the duke and duchess: he'll lie like to  your Switzer or lawyer; he'll be of any side for most  money.                                                           50  _Mal._ I am in haste, be brief.  _Pass._ As your fiddler when he is paid.--He'll thrive,  I warrant you, while your young courtier stands like  Good-Friday in Lent; men long to see it, because more  fatting days come after it; else he's the leanest and pitifullest  actor in the whole pageant. Adieu, Malevole.  _Mal._ [_Aside._] O world most vile, when thy loose vanities,  Taught by this fool, do make the fool seem wise!  _Pass._ You'll know me again, Malevole.  _Mal._ O, ay, by that velvet.                                    60  _Pass._ Ay, as a pettifogger by his buckram bag. I  am as common in the court as an hostess's lips in the  country; knights, and clowns, and knaves, and all share  me: the court cannot possibly be without me.

It giveth both inwards     and outwards a clearer light then glasse, and for this respect is     better than either glasse or horne; for that it neither breaketh     like glasse, nor yet will burne like the lanthorne."                              ACT II.                             SCENE I.                  _Chamber in the Duke's Palace._  _Enter_ MENDOZA _with a sconce,[408] to observe_ FERNEZE'S  _entrance, who, whilst the act is playing, enters unbraced, two  Pages before him with lights; is met by_ MAQUERELLE _and conveyed  in; the Pages[409] are sent away_.  _Men._ He's caught, the woodcock's head is i' the noose.  Now treads Ferneze in dangerous path of lust,  Swearing his sense is merely[410] deified:  The fool grasps clouds, and shall beget Centaurs:  And now, in strength of panting faint delight,  The goat bids heaven envy him.

Will ye sit and eat?  _Emil._ Good, the composure: the receipt, how is't?  _Maq._ 'Tis a pretty pearl; by this pearl (how does't  with me?) thus it is. Seven and thirty yolks of Barbary  hens' eggs; eighteen spoonfuls and a half of the  juice of cock-sparrow bones; one ounce, three drams,  four scruples, and one quarter of the syrup of Ethiopian  dates; sweetened with three quarters of a pound of pure  candied Indian eringoes; strewed over with the powder  of pearl of America, amber of Cataia, and lamb-stones  of Muscovia.                                                     15  _Bian._ Trust me, the ingredients are very cordial, and,  no question, good, and most powerful in restauration.[440]  _Maq._ I know not what you mean by restauration;  but this it doth,--it purifieth the blood, smootheth the  skin, enliveneth the eye, strengtheneth the veins, mundifieth  the teeth, comforteth the stomach, fortifieth the  back, and quickeneth the wit; that's all.                        22  _Emil._ By my troth, I have eaten but two spoonfuls,  and methinks I could discourse most swiftly and wittily  already.  _Maq._ Have you the art to seem honest?  _Bian._ Ay, thank advice and practice.                           27  _Maq._ Why, then, eat me o' this posset, quicken your  blood, and preserve your beauty.

I ha' been young, and  yet, in my conscience, I am not above five-and-twenty:  but, believe me, preserve and use your beauty; for youth  and beauty once gone, we are like bee-hives without  honey, out-o'-fashion apparel that no man will wear:  therefore use me your beauty.                                    45  _Emil._ Ay, but men say--  _Maq._ Men say! let men say what they will: life o'  woman! they are ignorant of our[443] wants.

I ha' seen a sumptuous steeple  turned to a stinking privy; more beastly, the sacredest  place made a dogs' kennel; nay, most inhuman, the  stoned coffins of long-dead Christians burst up, and made  hogs' troughs: _hic finis Priami_.[451] Shall I ha' some sack  and cheese at thy chamber? Good night, good mischievous  incarnate devil; good night, Mendoza; ah, ye  inhuman villain, good night! night, fub.                        202  _Men._ Goodnight: to-morrow morn?  _Mal._ Ay, I will come, friendly damnation, I will come.  [_Exit_ MENDOZA.] I do descry cross-points; honesty and  courtship straddle as far asunder as a true Frenchman's  legs.  _Fer._ O!  _Mal._ Proclamations! more proclamations!  _Fer._ O! a surgeon!                                            210  _Mal._ Hark! lust cries for a surgeon.

O, would I ne'er had known  My own dishonour! Good God, that men should desire  To search out that, which, being found, kills all  Their joy of life! to taste the tree of knowledge,  And then be driven from out paradise!--  Canst give me some comfort?                                      19  _Bil._ My lord, I have some books which have been  dedicated to my honour, and I ne'er read 'em, and yet  they had very fine names, _Physic for Fortune_,[454] _Lozenges  of sanctified sincerity_,[455] very pretty works of curates,  scriveners, and schoolmasters. Marry, I remember one  Seneca, Lucius Annｾus Seneca----  _Pietro._ Out upon him! he writ of temperance and  fortitude, yet lived like a voluptuous epicure, and died  like an effeminate coward.--Haste thee to Florence:  Here, take our letters; see 'em seal'd: away!  Report in private to the honour'd duke                           30  His daughter's forc'd disgrace; tell him at length  We know too much: due compliments[456] advance:  There's naught that's safe and sweet but ignorance.[457]                                                             [_Exit._                          _Enter_ BIANCA.  _Bil._ Madam, I am going ambassador for Florence;  'twill be great charges to me.  _Bian._ No matter, my lord, you have the lease of two  manors come out next Christmas; you may lay your  tenants on the greater rack for it: and when you come  home again, I'll teach you how you shall get two hundred  pounds a-year by your teeth.                                     40  _Bil._ How, madam?  _Bian._ Cut off so much from house-keeping: that  which is saved by the teeth, you know, is got by the  teeth.  _Bil._ 'Fore God, and so I may; I am in wondrous  credit, lady.  _Bian._ See the use of flattery: I did ever counsel you  to flatter greatness, and you have profited well: any  man that will do so shall be sure to be like your Scotch  barnacle,[458] now a block, instantly a worm, and presently a  great goose: this it is to rot and putrefy in the bosom of  greatness.                                                       52  _Bil._ Thou art ever my politician. O, how happy is  that old lord that hath a politician to his young lady!  I'll have fifty gentlemen shall attend upon me: marry,  the most of them shall be farmers' sons, because they  shall bear their own charges; and they shall go apparelled  thus,--in sea-water-green suits, ash-colour cloaks, watchet  stockings, and popinjay-green feathers: will not the  colours do excellent?                                            60  _Bian._ Out upon't! they'll look like citizens riding to  their friends at Whitsuntide; their apparel just so many  several parishes.  _Bil._ I'll have it so; and Passarello, my fool, shall go  along with me; marry, he shall be in velvet.  _Bian._ A fool in velvet!  _Bil._ Ay, 'tis common for your fool to wear satin; I'll  have mine in velvet.  _Bian._ What will you wear, then, my lord?                       69  _Bil._ Velvet too; marry, it shall be embroidered,  because I'll differ from the fool somewhat. I am horribly  troubled with the gout: nothing grieves me, but that  my doctor hath forbidden me wine, and you know your  ambassador must drink. Didst thou ask thy doctor what  was good for the gout?  _Bian._ Yes; he said, ease, wine, and women, were good  for it.  _Bil._ Nay, thou hast such a wit! What was good to  cure it, said he?                                                79  _Bian._ Why, the rack. All your empirics could never  do the like cure upon the gout the rack did in England,  or your Scotch boot.[459] The French harlequin[460] will  instruct you.  _Bil._ Surely, I do wonder how thou, having for the instructmost part of thy lifetime been a country body, shouldst instructhave so good a wit.  _Bian._ Who, I? why, I have been a courtier thrice two instructmonths.                                                   88  _Bil._ So have I this twenty year, and yet there was a instructgentleman-usher called me coxcomb t'other day, and to instructmy face too: was't not a backbiting rascal? I would I instructwere better travelled, that I might have been better instructacquainted with the fashions of several countrymen: but instructmy secretary, I think, he hath sufficiently instructed me.  _Bian._ How, my lord?  _Bil._ "Marry, my good lord," quoth he, "your lordship instructshall ever find amongst a hundred Frenchmen forty instructhot-shots; amongst a hundred Spaniards, three-score instructbraggarts; amongst a hundred Dutchmen, four-score instructdrunkards; amongst an hundred Englishmen, four-score instructand ten madmen; and amongst an hundred Welshmen"----     102  _Bian._ What, my lord?  _Bil._ "Four-score and nineteen gentlemen."[461]  _Bian._ But since you go about a sad embassy, I would instructhave you go in black, my lord.  _Bil._ Why, dost think I cannot mourn, unless I wear  my hat in cipres,[462] like an alderman's heir? that's vile,  instruct very old, in faith.  _Bian._ I'll learn of you shortly: O, we should have a  fine gallant of you, should not I instruct you! How will  you bear yourself when you come into the Duke of  Florence' court?                                                113  _Bil._ Proud enough, and 'twill do well enough: as I  walk up and down the chamber, I'll spit frowns about  me, have a strong perfume in my jerkin, let my beard  grow to make me look terrible, salute no man beneath  the fourth button; and 'twill do excellent.  _Bian._ But there is a very beautiful lady there; how  will you entertain her?                                         120  _Bil._ I'll tell you that, when the lady hath entertained  me: but to satisfy thee, here comes the fool.                        _Enter_ PASSARELLO.  Fool, thou shalt stand for the fair lady.  _Pass._ Your fool will stand for your lady most willingly  and most uprightly.  _Bil._ I'll salute her in Latin.  _Pass._ O, your fool can understand no Latin.  _Bil._ Ay, but your lady can.  _Pass._ Why, then, if your lady take down your fool, your  fool will stand no longer for your lady.                        130  _Bil._ A pestilent fool! 'fore God, I think the world  be turned upside down too.  _Pass._ O, no, sir; for then your lady and all the ladies  in the palace should go with their heels upward, and that  were a strange sight, you know.  _Bil._ There be many will repine at my preferment.  _Pass._ O, ay, like the envy of an elder sister, that hath  her younger made a lady before her.  _Bil._ The duke is wondrous discontented.  _Pass._ Ay, and more melancholic than a usurer having  all his money out at the death of a prince.                     141  _Bil._ Didst thou see Madam Floria to-day?  _Pass._ Yes, I found her repairing her face to-day; the  red upon the white showed as if her cheeks should have  been served in for two dishes of barberries in stewed  broth, and the flesh to them a woodcock.  _Bil._ A bitter fool![463]--Come, madam, this night thou  shalt enjoy me freely, and to-morrow for Florence.              148  _Pass._ What a natural fool is he that would be a pair  of boddice to a woman's petticoat, to be trussed and  pointed to them! Well, I'll dog my lord; and the word  is proper: for when I fawn upon him, he feeds me; when  I snap him by the fingers, he spits in my mouth. If a  dog's death were not strangling, I had rather be one  than a serving-man; for the corruption of coin is either  the generation of a usurer or a lousy beggar.                                   [_Exeunt_ BIANCA _and_ PASSARELLO.       _Enter_ MALEVOLE _in some frize gown, whilst_ BILIOSO                        _reads his patent_.  _Mal._ I cannot sleep; my eyes' ill-neighbouring lids  Will hold no fellowship. O thou pale sober night,  Thou that in sluggish fumes all sense dost steep;  Thou that giv'st all the world full leave to play,              160  Unbend'st the feebled veins of sweaty labour!  The galley-slave, that all the toilsome day  Tugs at his oar against the stubborn wave,  Straining his rugged veins, snores fast;  The stooping scythe-man, that doth barb the field,  Thou mak'st wink sure: in night all creatures sleep;  Only the malcontent, that 'gainst his fate  Repines and quarrels,--alas, he's goodman tell-clock!  His sallow jaw-bones sink with wasting moan;  Whilst others' beds are down, his pillow's stone.               170  _Bil._ Malevole!  _Mal._ Elder of Israel, thou honest defect of wicked  nature and obstinate ignorance, when did thy wife let  thee lie with her?  _Bil._ I am going ambassador to Florence.  _Mal._ Ambassador! Now, for thy country's honour,  prithee, do not put up mutton and porridge i' thy cloakbag.  Thy young lady wife goes to Florence with thee  too, does she not?  _Bil._ No, I leave her at the palace.                           180  _Mal._ At the palace! Now, discretion shield, man;  for God's love, let's ha' no more cuckolds! Hymen  begins to put off his saffron[464] robe: keep thy wife i' the  state of grace. Heart o' truth, I would sooner leave my  lady singled in a bordello than in the Genoa palace:  Sin there appearing in her sluttish shape,  Would soon grow loathsome, even to blushes' sense;  Surfeit would choke[465] intemperate appetite,  Make the soul scent the rotten breath of lust.  When in an Italian lascivious palace,                           190  A lady guardianless,  Left to the push of all allurement,  The strongest incitements to immodesty,  To have her bound, incens'd with wanton sweets,  Her veins fill'd high with heating delicates,  Soft rest, sweet music, amorous masquerers,  Lascivious banquets, sin itself gilt o'er,  Strong fantasy tricking up strange delights,  Presenting it dress'd pleasingly to sense,  Sense leading it unto the soul, confirm'd                       200  With potent examples impudent custom,  Entic'd by that great bawd, opportunity;[466]  Thus being prepar'd, clap to her easy ear  Youth in good clothes, well-shap'd, rich,  Fair-spoken, promising, noble, ardent, blood-full,  Witty, flattering,--Ulysses absent,  O Ithaca,[467] can chastest Penelope hold out?  _Bil._ Mass, I'll think on't. Farewell.  _Mal._ Farewell. Take thy wife with thee.

Come, a-cap-a-pe,  how? inform.  _Men._ Know that this weak-brain'd duke, who only stands  On Florence' stilts, hath out of witless zeal  Made me his heir, and secretly confirm'd  The wreath to me after his life's full point.                   300  _Mal._ Upon what merit?  _Men._ Merit! by heaven, I horn him:  Only Ferneze's death gave me state's life.  Tut, we are politic, he must not live now.  _Mal._ No reason, marry: but how must he die now?  _Men._ My utmost project is to murder the duke, that  I might have his state, because he makes me his heir;  to banish the duchess, that I might be rid of a cunning  Lacedｾmonian, because I know Florence will forsake  her; and then to marry Maria, the banished Duke  Altofront's wife, that her friends might strengthen me  and my faction: that is all, la.                                311  _Mal._ Do you love Maria?  _Men._ Faith, no great affection, but as wise men do  love great women, to ennoble their blood and augment  their revenue.

O  dear ladies, the most piteous disaster! Ferneze was  taken last night in the duchess' chamber: alas, the duke  catched him and killed him!  _Bian._ Was he found in bed?                                     17  _Maq._ O, no; but the villainous certainty is, the door  was not bolted, the tongue-tied hatch held his peace: so  the naked troth is, he was found in his shirt, whilst I,  like an arrant beast, lay in the outward chamber, heard  nothing; and yet they came by me in the dark, and yet  I felt them not, like a senseless creature as I was. O  beauties, look to your busk-points;[484] if not chastely, yet  charily: be sure the door be bolted.--Is your lord gone  to Florence?  _Bian._ Yes, Maquerelle.                                         27  _Maq._ I hope you'll find the discretion to purchase a  fresh gown 'fore his return.--Now, by my troth, beauties,  I would ha' ye once wise: he loves ye; pish! he is witty;  bubble! fair-proportioned; mew! nobly-born; wind!  Let this be still your fixed position; esteem me every  man according to his good gifts, and so ye shall ever remain  most worthy to be, most dear ladies.  _Emil._ Is the duke returned from hunting yet?  _Maq._ They say not yet.  _Bian._ 'Tis now in midst of day.                                37  _Emil._ How bears the duchess with this blemish now?  _Maq._ Faith, boldly; strongly defies defame, as one  that has a duke to her father. And there's a note to  you: be sure of a stout friend in a corner, that may  always awe your husband. Mark the behaviour of the  duchess now: she dares defame; cries, "Duke, do what  thou canst, I'll quit mine honour:" nay, as one confirmed  in her own virtue against ten thousand mouths that  mutter her disgrace, she's presently for dances.  _Bian._ For dances!  _Maq._ Most true.  _Emil._ Most strange.                         _Enter_ FERRARDO.  See, here's my servant, young Ferrardo: how many servants  thinkest thou I have, Maquerelle?                                51  _Maq._ The more, the merrier: 'twas well said, use  your servants as you do your smocks; have many, use  one, and change often; for that's most sweet and court-like.  _Fer._ Save ye, fair ladies! Is the duke return'd?  _Bian._ Sweet sir, no voice of him as yet in court.  _Fer._ 'Tis very strange.  _Bian._ And how like you my servant, Maquerelle?                 59  _Maq._ I think he could hardly draw Ulysses' bow; but,  by my fidelity, were his nose narrower, his eyes broader,  his hands thinner, his lips thicker, his legs bigger, his  feet lesser, his hair blacker, and his teeth whiter, he were  a tolerable sweet youth, i'faith.

There's Maquerelle, oldest bawd and a  perpetual beggar--did you never hear of her trick to  be known in the city?  _Bil._ Never.  _Pass._ Why, she gets all the picture-makers to draw  her picture; when they have done, she most courtly  finds fault with them one after another, and never  fetcheth them: they, in revenge of this, execute her in  pictures as they do in Germany, and hang her in their  shops: by this means is she better known to the stinkards  than if she had been five times carted.                          35  _Bil._ 'Fore God, an excellent policy.  _Pass._ Are there any revels to-night, my lord?  _Bil._ Yes.  _Pass._ Good my lord, give me leave to break a fellow's  pate that hath abused me.                                        40  _Bil._ Whose pate?  _Pass._ Young Ferrardo, my lord.  _Bil._ Take heed, he's very valiant; I have known him  fight eight quarrels in five days, believe it.  _Pass._ O, is he so great a quarreller? why, then, he's an  arrant coward.  _Bil._ How prove you that?  _Pass._ Why, thus. He that quarrels seeks to fight;  and he that seeks to fight seeks to die; and he that seeks  to die seeks never to fight more; and he that will quarrel,  and seeks means never to answer a man more, I think  he's a coward.                                                   52  _Bil._ Thou canst prove anything.  _Pass._ Anything but a rich knave; for I can flatter no  man.  _Bil._ Well, be not drunk, good fool: I shall see you  anon in the presence.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [528] This scene was added in ed. 2.     [529] Reed suggests that this word may be derived from old Fr.     _coisser_ (= incommoder) or _coiter_ (= presser, exciter).

The Dutchman for a drunkard_,--  _Maq. The Dane for golden locks_,--  _Mal. The Irishman for usquebaugh_,--  _Maq. The Frenchman for the_ (----).  _Mal._ O, thou art a blessed creature! had I a modest  woman to conceal, I would put her to thy custody; for  no reasonable creature would ever suspect her to be in  thy company: ah, thou art a melodious Maquerelle,--thou  picture of a woman, and substance of a beast!                  _Enter_ PASSARELLO _with wine._  _Maq._ O fool,[531] will ye be ready anon to go with me to  the revels? the hall will be so pestered anon.                   11  _Pass._ Ay, as the country is with attorneys.  _Mal._ What hast thou there, fool?  _Pass._ Wine; I have learned to drink since I went with  my lord ambassador: I'll drink to the health of Madam  Maquerelle.  _Mal._ Why, thou wast wont to rail upon her.  _Pass._ Ay; but since I borrowed money of her, I'll  drink to her health now; as gentlemen visit brokers, or  as knights send venison to the city, either to take up  more money, or to procure longer forbearance.                    21  _Mal._ Give me the bowl. I drink a health to Altofront,  our deposed duke.                                        [_Drinks._  _Pas._ I'll take it [_Drinks_]:--so. Now I'll begin a  health to Madam Maquerelle.                              [_Drinks._  _Mal._ Pooh! I will not pledge her.  _Pass._ Why, I pledged your lord.  _Mal._ I care not.  _Pass._ Not pledge Madam Maquerelle! why, then,  will I spew up your lord again with this fool's finger.          30  _Mal._ Hold; I'll take it.                               [_Drinks._  _Maq._ Now thou hast drunk my health, fool, I am  friends with thee.  _Pass._ Art? art?       When Griffon[532] saw the reconcil重 quean         Offering about his neck her arms to cast,       He threw off sword and heart's malignant spleen,         And lovely her below the loins embrac'd.--  Adieu, Madam Maquerelle.                                  [_Exit._  _Mal._ And how dost thou think o' this transformation  of state now?                                                      41  _Maq._ Verily, very well; for we women always note,  the falling of the one is the rising of the other; some must  be fat, some must be lean; some must be fools, and some  must be lords; some must be knaves, and some must be  officers; some must be beggars, some must be knights;  some must be cuckolds, and some must be citizens. As  for example, I have two court-dogs, the most fawning  curs, the one called Watch, the other Catch: now I, like  Lady Fortune, sometimes love this dog, sometimes raise  that dog, sometimes favour Watch, most commonly fancy  Catch. Now, that dog which I favour I feed; and he's  so ravenous, that what I give he never chaws it, gulps it  down whole, without any relish of what he has, but with  a greedy expectation of what he shall have. The other  dog now----                                                      56  _Mal._ No more dog, sweet Maquerelle, no more dog.  And what hope hast thou of the Duchess Maria? will  she stoop to the duke's lure? will she come,[533] thinkest?  _Maq._ Let me see, where's the sign now? ha' ye e'er a  calendar? where's the sign, trow you?                            61  _Mal._ Sign! why, is there any moment in that?  _Maq._ O, believe me, a most secret power: look ye, a  Chaldean or an Assyrian, I am sure 'twas a most sweet  Jew, told me, court any woman in the right sign, you  shall not miss. But you must take her in the right vein  then; as, when the sign is in Pisces, a fishmonger's  wife is very sociable; in Cancer, a precisian's wife is very  flexible; in Capricorn, a merchant's wife hardly holds  out; in Libra, a lawyer's wife is very tractable, especially  if her husband be at the term; only in Scorpio 'tis very  dangerous meddling. Has the duke sent any jewel, any  rich stones?                                                     73  _Mal._ Ay, I think those are the best signs to take a  lady in.                          _Enter_ Captain.  By your favour, signior, I must discourse with the Lady  Maria, Altofront's duchess; I must enter for the duke.  _Capt._ She here shall give you interview: I received  the guardship of this citadel from the good Altofront,  and for his use I'll keep't, till I am of no use.                80  _Mal._ Wilt thou? O heavens, that a Christian should  be found in a buff-jerkin! Captain Conscience, I love  thee, captain. We attend.                                                     [_Exit_ Captain.  And what hope hast thou of this duchess' easiness?  _Maq._ 'Twill go hard, she was a cold creature ever;  she hated monkeys, fools, jesters, and gentlemen-ushers  extremely; she had the vile trick on't, not only to be  truly modestly honourable in her own conscience, but  she would avoid the least wanton carriage that might  incur suspect; as, God bless me, she had almost brought  bed-pressing out of fashion; I could scarce get a fine for  the lease of a lady's favour once in a fortnight.                92  _Mal._ Now, in the name of immodesty, how many  maidenheads has thou brought to the block?  _Maq._ Let me see: heaven forgive us our misdeeds!--Here's  the duchess.                   _Enter_ MARIA _with_ Captain.  _Mal._ God bless thee, lady!  _Maria._ Out of thy company!  _Mal._ We have brought thee tender of a husband.  _Maria._ I hope I have one already.                             100  _Maq._ Nay, by mine honour, madam, as good ha' ne'er  a husband as a banished husband; he's in another world  now. I'll tell ye, lady, I have heard of a sect that maintained,  when the husband was asleep the wife might  lawfully entertain another man, for then her husband  was as dead; much more when he is banished.  _Maria._ Unhonest creature!  _Maq._ Pish, honesty is but an art to seem so:  Pray ye, what's honesty, what's constancy,  But fables feign'd, odd old fools' chat, devis'd                110  By jealous fools to wrong our liberty?  _Mal._ Molly, he that loves thee is a duke, Mendoza;  he will maintain thee royally, love thee ardently, defend  thee powerfully, marry thee sumptuously, and keep thee,  in despite of Rosicleer or Donzel del Phebo.[534] There's  jewels: if thou wilt, so; if not, so.  _Maria._ Captain, for God's love,[535] save poor wretchedness  From tyranny of lustful insolence!  Enforce me in the deepest dungeon dwell,  Rather than here; here round about is hell.--                   120  O my dear'st Altofront! where'er thou breathe,  Let my soul sink into the shades beneath,  Before I stain thine honour! 'tis[536] thou has't,  And long as I can die, I will live chaste.  _Mal._ 'Gainst him that can enforce how vain is strife!  _Maria._ She that can be enforc'd has ne'er a knife:  She that through force her limbs with lust enrolls,  Wants Cleopatra's asps and Portia's coals.  God amend you!                                                  129                                                [_Exit with_ Captain.  _Mal._ Now, the fear of the devil for ever go with      thee!--Maquerelle,  I tell thee, I have found an honest  woman: faith, I perceive, when all is done, there is of  women, as of all other things, some good, most bad;  some saints, some sinners: for as nowadays no courtier  but has his mistress, no captain but has his cockatrice,[537]  no cuckold but has his horns, and no fool but has his  feather; even so, no woman but has her weakness and  feather too, no sex but has his--I can hunt the letter no  farther.--[_Aside_] O God, how loathsome this toying is  to me! that a duke should be forced to fool it! well,  _stultorum plena sunt omnia_:[538] better play the fool lord  than be the fool lord.--Now, where's your sleights,  Madam Maquerelle?                                               143  _Maq._ Why, are ye ignorant that 'tis said a squeamish  affected niceness is natural to women, and that the  excuse of their yielding is only, forsooth, the difficult  obtaining? You must put her to't: women are flax, and  will fire in a moment.  _Mal._ Why, was the flax put into thy mouth, and yet  thou--Thou set fire, thou inflame her!                          150  _Maq._ Marry, but I'll tell ye now, you were too hot.  _Mal._ The fitter to have inflamed the flax, woman.  _Maq._ You were too boisterous, spleeny, for, indeed----  _Mal._ Go, go, thou art a weak pandress: now I see,  Sooner earth's fire heaven itself shall waste,  Than all with heat can melt a mind that's chaste.  Go: thou the duke's lime-twig! I'll make the duke turn  thee out of thine office: what, not get one touch of hope,  and had her at such advantage!                                  160  Maq. Now, o' my conscience, now I think in my discretion,  we did not take her in the right sign; the blood  was not in the true vein, sure.                                                             [_Exit._                          _Enter_ BILIOSO.  _Bil._ Make way[539] there! the duke returns from the  enthronement.--Malevole,--  _Mal._ Out, rogue!  _Bil._ Malevole,--  _Mal._ Hence, ye gross-jawed, peasantly--out, go![540]          168  _Bil._ Nay, sweet Malevole, since my return I hear you  are become the thing I always prophesied would be,--an  advanced virtue, a worthily-employed faithfulness, a  man o' grace, dear friend. Come; what! _Si quoties  peccant homines_[541]--if as often as courtiers play the knaves,  honest men should be angry--why, look ye, we must  collogue[542] sometimes, forswear sometimes.  _Mal._ Be damned sometimes.  _Bil._ Right: _nemo omnibus horis sapit_; no man can be  honest at all hours: necessity often depraves virtue.  _Mal._ I will commend thee to the duke.  _Bil._ Do: let us be friends, man.                              180  _Mal._ And knaves, man.  _Bil._ Right: let us prosper and purchase:[543] our lordships  shall live, and our knavery be forgotten.  _Mal._ He that by any ways gets riches, his means never  shames him.  _Bil._ True.  _Mal._ For impudency and faithlessness are the main  stays to greatness.  _Bil._ By the Lord, thou art a profound lad.  _Mal._ By the Lord, thou art a perfect knave: out, ye  ancient damnation!                                              191  _Bil._ Peace, peace! and thou wilt not be a friend to  me as I am a knave, be not a knave to me as I am thy  friend, and disclose me.

Come hither, come hither.                     201  _Mal._ Thou hast a certain strong villainous scent about  thee my nature cannot endure.  _Men._ Scent, man! What returns Maria, what answer  to our suit?  _Mal._ Cold, frosty; she is obstinate.  _Men._ Then she's but dead; 'tis resolute, she dies:  Black deed only through black deed[544] safely flies.  _Mal._ Pooh! _per scelera semper sceleribus tutum est iter_.[545]  _Men._ What, art a scholar? art a politician? sure, thou  art an arrant knave.                                            211  _Mal._ Who, I? I ha' been twice an under-sheriff,  man.[546] Well, I will go rail upon some great man, that I  may purchase the bastinado, or else go marry some rich  Genoan lady, and instantly go travel.  _Men._ Travel, when thou art married?  _Mal._ Ay, 'tis your young lord's fashion to do so,  though he was so lazy, being a bachelor, that he would  never travel so far as the university: yet when he  married her, tales off, and, Catso,[547] for England!           220  _Men._ And why for England?  _Mal._ Because there is no brothel-houses there.  _Men._ Nor courtezans?  _Mal._ Neither; your whore went down with the stews,  and your punk came up with your puritan.  _Men._ Canst thou empoison? canst thou empoison?  _Mal._ Excellently; no Jew, pothecary, or politician  better. Look ye, here's a box: whom wouldst thou  empoison? here's a box [_Giving it_], which, opened and  the fume ta'en[548] up in conduits[549] thorough which the  brain purges itself, doth instantly for twelve hours' space  bind up all show of life in a deep senseless sleep: here's  another [_Giving it_], which, being opened under the  sleeper's nose, chokes all the pores[550] of life, kills him  suddenly.                                                       235  _Men._ I'll try experiments; 'tis good not to be deceived.--So,  so; catso!
