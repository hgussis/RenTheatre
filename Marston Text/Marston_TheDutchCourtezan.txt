                             PROLOGUE.


  Slight hasty labours in this easy play
  Present not what you would, but what we may:
  For this vouchsafe to know,--the only end
  Of our now study is, not to offend.
  Yet think not but, like others, rail we could
  (Best art presents not what it can but should);
  And if our pen in this seem over-slight,
  We strive not to instruct, but to delight.
  As for some few, we know of purpose here
  To tax and scout, know firm art cannot fear                    10
  Vain rage; only the highest grace we pray
  Is, you'll not tax until you judge our play.
  Think, and then speak: 'tis rashness, and not wit,
  To speak what is in passion, and not judgment fit.
  Sit then with fair expectance, and survey
  Nothing but passionate man in his slight play,
  Who hath this only ill, to some deem'd worst--
  A modest diffidence, and self-mistrust.


                        _Fabulæ Argumentum._

  The difference betwixt the love of a courtezan and a wife is the full
  scope of the play, which, intermixed with the deceits of a witty city
  jester, fills up the comedy.

                              SCENE I.

                            _A Street._

       _Enter three Pages, with lights._ MULLIGRUB, FREEVILL,
               MALHEUREUX, TYSEFEW, _and_ CAQUETEUR.


  _Free._ Nay, comfort, my good host Shark; my good
  Mulligrub.

  _Mal._ Advance thy snout; do not suffer thy sorrowful
  nose to drop on thy Spanish[2] leather jerkin, most
  hardly-honest Mulligrub.

  _Free._ What, cogging Cocledemoy is run away with
  a neast[3] of goblets? True, what then? they will be
  hammered out well enough, I warrant you.

  _Mul._ Sure, some wise man would find them out
  presently.                                                       10

  _Free._ Yes, sure, if we could find out some wise man
  presently.

  _Mal._ How was the plate lost? how did it vanish?

  _Free._ In most sincere prose, thus: that man of much
  money, some wit, but less honesty, cogging Cocledemoy,
  comes this night late into mine hostess Mulligrub's
  tavern here; calls for a room; the house being full,
  Cocledemoy consorted with his movable chattel, his
  instrument of fornication, the bawd Mrs. Mary Faugh,
  are imparlour'd next the street; good poultry was their
  food, blackbird, lark, woodcock; and mine host here
  comes in, cries "God bless you!" and departs. A
  blind harper enters, craves audience, uncaseth, plays;
  the drawer, for female privateness' sake, is nodded out,
  who knowing that whosoever will hit the mark of profit
  must, like those that shoot in stone-bows,[4] wink with
  one eye, grows blind o' the right side, and departs.             27

  _Caq._ He shall answer for that winking with one eye
  at the last day.

  _Mal._ Let him have day[5] till then, and he will wink
  with both his eyes.

  _Free._ Cocledemoy, perceiving none in the room but
  the blind harper (whose eyes Heaven had shut up from
  beholding wickedness), unclasps a casement to the
  street very patiently, pockets up three bowls unnaturally,
  thrusts his wench forth the window, and himself
  most preposterously, with his heels forward, follows:
  the unseeing harper plays on, bids the empty dishes and
  the treacherous candles much good do them. The
  drawer returns, but, out alas! not only the birds, but
  also the neast of goblets, were flown away. Laments
  are raised----                                                   42

  _Tys._ Which did not pierce the heavens.

  _Free._ The drawers moan, mine host doth cry, the
  bowls are gone.

  _Mul._ _Hic finis Priami!_

  _Mal._ Nay, be not jaw-fall'n, my most sharking Mulligrub.

  _Free._ 'Tis your just affliction; remember the sins of
  the cellar, and repent, repent!                                  50

  _Mul._ I am not jaw-fall'n, but I will hang the coney-catching
  Cocledemoy; and there's an end of't.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Caq._ Is it a right stone? it shows well by candle-light.

  _Free._ So do many things that are counterfeit, but I
  assure you this is a right diamond.

  _Caq._ Might I borrow it of you? it will not a little
  grace my finger in visitation of my mistress.

  _Free._ Why, use it, most sweet Caqueteur, use it.

  _Caq._ Thanks, good sir; 'tis grown high night:
  gentles, rest to you.
                                                             [_Exit._

  _Tys._ A torch! Sound wench, soft sleep, and sanguine
  dreams to you both. On, boy!                                     62

  _Free._ Let me bid you good rest.

  _Mal._ Not so, trust me, I must bring my friend home:
  I dare not give you up to your own company; I fear
  the warmth of wine and youth will draw you to some
  common house of lascivious entertainment.

  _Free._ Most necessary buildings, Malheureux; ever
  since my intention of marriage, I do pray for their
  continuance.                                                     70

  _Mal._ Loved sir, your reason?

  _Free._ Marry, lest my house should be made one. I
  would have married men love the stews as Englishmen
  loved the Low Countries: wish war should be maintain'd
  there, lest it should come home to their own doors.
  What, [not] suffer a man to have a hole to put his head
  in, though he go to the pillory for it! Youth and appetite
  are above the club of Hercules.

  _Mal._ This lust is a most deadly sin, sure.

  _Free._ Nay, 'tis a most lively sin, sure.                       80

  _Mal._ Well, I am sure, 'tis one of the head sins.

  _Free._ Nay, I am sure it is one of the middle sins.

  _Mal._ Pity 'tis grown a most daily vice.

  _Free._ But a more nightly vice, I assure you.

  _Mal._ Well, 'tis a sin.

  _Free._ Ay, or else few men would wish to go to heaven:
  and, not to disguise with my friend, I am now going the
  way of all flesh.

  _Mal._ Not to a courtezan?

  _Free._ A courteous one.                                         90

  _Mal._ What, to a sinner?

  _Free._ A very publican.

  _Mal._ Dear, my loved friend, let me be full with you:
  Know, sir, the strongest argument that speaks
  Against the soul's eternity is lust,
  That wise man's folly, and the fool's wisdom:
  But to grow wild in loose lasciviousness,
  Given up to heat and sensual appetite,
  Nay, to expose your health and strength and name,
  Your precious time, and with that time the hope                 100
  Of due preferment, advantageous means,
  Of any worthy end, to the stale use,
  The common bosom of a money creature,
  One that sells human flesh--a mangonist!

  _Free._ Alas, good creatures! what would you have
  them do? Would you have them get their living by
  the curse of man, the sweat of their brows? So they do:
  every man must follow his trade, and every woman her
  occupation. A poor decayed mechanical man's wife,
  her husband is laid up, may not she lawfully be laid
  down, when her husband's only rising is by his wife's
  falling? A captain's wife wants means; her commander
  lies in open fields abroad, may not she lie in civil arms
  at home? A waiting gentlewoman, that had wont to
  take say[6] to her lady, miscarries or so; the court
  misfortune throws her down; may not the city courtesy
  take her up? Do you know no alderman would pity
  such a woman's case?[7] Why, is charity grown a sin,
  or relieving the poor and impotent an offence? You
  will say beasts take no money for their fleshly entertainment:
  true, because they are beasts, therefore beastly;[8]
  only men give to loose, because they are men, therefore
  manly: and indeed, wherein should they bestow their
  money better? In land, the title may be crack'd; in
  houses, they may be burnt; in apparel, 'twill wear; in
  wine, alas for our pity! our throat is but short: but
  employ your[9] money upon women, and a thousand to
  nothing, some one of them will bestow that on you
  which shall stick by you as long as you live; they are
  no ungrateful persons, they will give quid [10] for quo: do
  ye protest, they'll swear; do you rise, they'll fall; do
  you fall, they'll rise; do you give them the French
  crown, they'll give you the French--_O justus justa
  justum!_ They sell their bodies: do not better persons
  sell their souls? nay, since all things have been sold,
  honour, justice, faith, nay, even God Himself,                  136
  Aye me, what base ignobleness is it
  To sell the pleasure of a wanton bed!
  Why do men scrape, why heap to full heaps join?
  But for his mistress, who would care for coin?
  For this I hold to be denied of no man,
  All things are made for man, and man for woman.
  Give me my fee.

  _Mal._ Of ill you merit well. My heart's good friend,
  Leave yet at length, at length; for know this ever,
  'Tis no such sin to err, but to persever.

  _Free._ Beauty is woman's virtue, love the life's music,
  and woman the dainties, or second course of heaven's
  curious workmanship. Since then beauty, love, and
  woman are good, how can the love of woman's beauty
  be bad? and, _Bonum, quo communius, eo melius_: wilt
  then go with me?                                                152

  _Mal._ Whither?

  _Free._ To a house of salvation.

  _Mal._ Salvation?

  _Free._ Yes, 'twill make thee repent. Wilt go to the
  family of love?[11] I will show thee my creature; a pretty
  nimble-ey'd Dutch tanakin;[12] an honest soft-hearted
  impropriation; a soft, plump, round-cheek'd froe,[13] that
  has beauty enough for her virtue, virtue enough for a
  woman, and woman enough for any reasonable man in
  my knowledge. Wilt pass along with me?                          162

  _Mal._ What, to a brothel?--to behold an impudent
  prostitution;[14] fie on't, I shall hate the whole sex to see
  her. The most odious spectacle the earth can present
  is an immodest vulgar woman.

  _Free._ Good still; my brain shall keep't. You must
  go as you love me.

  _Mal._ Well, I'll go to make her loath the shame she's in;
  The sight of vice augments the hate of sin.                     170

  _Free._ The sight of vice augments the hate of sin!
  Very fine, perdy!

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [1] In the old eds., opposite the title, is written, "Turpe est
     difficiles habere nugas." The quotation is from Martial, ii. 86.

     [2] Spanish leather was held in great esteem.--See Middleton,
     viii. 70.

     [3] The word "nest" was frequently written "neast." (Cotgrave
     has--"_Nicher._ To _neastle_, build or make a _neast_ in;"
     "_Nid_: neast.") A "nest of goblets" was a large goblet
     containing several others of gradually diminishing size.

     [4] A cross-bow for shooting stones or bullets. ("_Arbaleste à
     boulet._" A _stone-bow_.--_Cotgrave._)

     [5] A debtor was said to have _day_ (or _longer day_) when his
     creditors allowed him to defer payment.

     [6] "Take say" is used here with a double meaning. "Say" was a
     sort of delicate serge; but the waiting-woman _takes say_
     (_i.e._, assay) because she tastes before her mistress (and is
     suitably rewarded for her lickorousness).

     [7] A play on words: (1) case; (2) kaze ( = _pudendum muliebre_).

     [8] Compare the witticism of Julia, daughter of Augustus, in
     Macrobius (_Saturn._, ii. 5).

     [9] Ed. 2. "you."

     [10] Old eds. "quite" and "quit."

     [11] For an account of the religious sect called _The Family of
     Love_, see Middleton, iii. 3-5.

     [12] Halliwell (_Dict. of Arch. and Prov. Words_) quotes from
     Armin's _Nest of Ninnies_:--"Out she would, tucks up her
     trinkets, like a Dutch _tannikin_ sliding to market on the ice,
     and away she flings."

     [13] Woman (_Dutch_).

     [14] Whore. (The word _brothel_ was so used).--Cf. Middleton, i.
     269: "I may grace her with the name of a courtezan, a backslider,
     a _prostitution_," &c.


                             SCENE II.

                            _A Brothel._

                _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY _and_ MARY FAUGH.


  _Coc._ Mary, Mary Faugh.

  _Mar._ Hem.[15]

  _Coc._ Come, my worshipful rotten rough-bellied bawd!
  ha! my blue-tooth'd patroness of natural wickedness,
  give me the goblets.

  _Mar._ By yea and by nay, Master Cocledemoy, I fear
  you'll play the knave, and restore them.

  _Coc._ No, by the lord, aunt,[16] restitution is catholic,
  and thou know'st we love----

  _Mar._ What?                                                     10

  _Coc._ Oracles are ceased: _tempus præteritum_, doest hear,
  my worshipful glysterpipe, thou ungodly fire that burnt
  Diana's temple?--doest hear, bawd?

  _Mar._ In very good truthness, you are the foulest-mouth'd,
  profane, railing brother, call a woman the most
  ungodly names: I must confess, we all eat of the forbidden
  fruit, and for mine own part, though I am one of
  the family of love, and, as they say, a bawd that covers
  the multitude of sins, yet I trust I am none of the wicked
  that eat fish o' Fridays.                                        20

  _Coc._ Hang toasts! I rail at thee, my worshipful organ-bellows
  that fills the pipes, my fine rattling fleamy cough
  o' the lungs, and cold with a pox? I rail at thee? what,
  my right precious pandress, supportress of barber-surgeons,
  and enhanceress[17] of lotium[18] and diet-drink?[19]
  I rail at thee, necessary damnation? I'll make an
  oration, I, in praise of thy most courtly in-fashion and
  most pleasureable function, I.

  _Mar._ Ay, prithee do, I love to hear myself praised, as
  well as any old lady, I.                                         30

  _Coc._ List then:--a bawd; first for her profession or
  vocation, it is most worshipful of all the twelve companies;
  for, as that trade is most honourable that sells
  the best commodities--as the draper is more worshipful
  than the pointmaker, the silkman more worshipful than
  the draper, and the goldsmith more honourable than
  both, little Mary, so the bawd above all: her shop has
  the best ware; for where these sell but cloth, satins, and
  jewels, she sells divine virtues, as virginity, modesty, and
  such rare gems; and those not like a petty chapman, by
  retail, but like a great merchant, by wholesale; wa, ha,
  ho! And who are her customers? Not base corn-cutters
  or sowgelders, but most rare wealthy knights,
  and most rare bountiful lords, are her customers. Again,
  whereas no trade or vocation profiteth but by the loss
  and displeasure of another--as the merchant thrives not
  but by the licentiousness of giddy[20] and unsettled youth;
  the lawyer, but by the vexation of his client; the physician,
  but by the maladies of his patient--only my
  smooth-gumm'd bawd lives by others' pleasure, and
  only grows rich by others' rising. O merciful gain, O
  righteous in-come! So much for her vocation, trade,
  and life. As for their death, how can it be bad, since
  their wickedness is always before their eyes, and a
  death's[21] head most commonly on their middle-finger?
  To conclude, 'tis most certain they must needs both live
  well and die well, since most commonly they live in
  Clerkenwell,[22] and die in Bride-well. _Dixi, Mary._           158

                 _Enter_ FREEVILL _and_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ Come along, yonder's the preface or exordium
  to my wench, the bawd. Fetch, fetch! What! Mr.
  Cocledemoy, is your knaveship yet stirring? Look to it,
  Mulligrub lies[23] for you.

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ The more fool he; I can lie for myself, worshipful
  friend. Hang toasts! I vanish. Ha! my fine boy,
  thou art a scholar, and hast read Tully's _Offices_, my fine
  knave. Hang toasts!

  _Free._ The vintner will toast you, and he catch you.

  _Coc._ I will draw the vintner to the stoop, and when
  he runs low, tilt him. Ha! my fine knave, art going to
  thy recreation?                                                 170

  _Free._ Yes, my capricious rascal.

  _Coc._ Thou wilt look like a fool then, by and by.

  _Free._ Look like a fool, why?

  _Coc._ Why, according to the old saying: a beggar
  when he is lousing of himself, looks like a philosopher;
  a hard-bound philosopher, when he is on the stool, looks
  like a tyrant; and a wise man, when he is in his belly
  act, looks like a fool. God give your worship good rest!
  grace and mercy keep your syringe straight, and your
  lotium unspilt.                                                 180

                       _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Free._ See, sir, this is she.

  _Mal._ This?

  _Free._ This.

  _Mal._ A courtezan?--Now, cold blood defend me!
  What a propension[24] afflicts me!

  _Fran._ O, mine aderliver[25] love, vat sall me do to requit
  dis your mush affection?

  _Free._ Marry, salute my friend, clip his neck, and kiss
  him welcome.

  _Fran._ A' mine art, sir, you bin very velcome.                 190

  _Free._ Kiss her, man, with a more familiar affection, so.
  Come, what entertainment? go to your lute.

                                              [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA.

  And how dost approve my sometimes elected? She's
  none of your ramping cannibals that devour man's flesh,
  nor any of your Curtian gulfs that will never be satisfied
  until the best thing a man has be thrown into them.
  I loved her with my heart, until my soul showed me the
  imperfection of my body, and placed my affection on a
  lawful love, my modest Beatrice, which if this shortheels
  knew, there were no being for me with eyes before her
  face. But, faith, dost thou not somewhat excuse my
  sometimes incontinency, with her enforcive beauties?
  Speak.                                                          203

  _Mal._ Hah! she is a whore, is she not?

  _Free._ Whore? fie, whore! you may call her a courtezan,
  a cockatrice,[26] or (as that worthy spirit of an eternal happiness
  said) a suppository. But whore! fie, 'tis not in
  fashion to call things by their right names. Is a great
  merchant a cuckold, you must say he is one of the
  livery. Is a great lord a fool, you must say he is weak.
  Is a gallant pocky, you must say he has the court scab.
  Come, she's your mistress or so.                                212

               _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA, _with her lute_.

  Come, siren, your voice.

  _Fra._ Vill not you stay in mine bosom to-night, love?

  _Free._ By no means, sweet breast; this gentleman has
  vow'd to see me chastely laid.

  _Fra._ He shall have a bed too, if dat it please him.

  _Free._ Peace, you tender him offence; he is one of a
  professed abstinence. Siren, your voice and away.

                      _She sings to her Lute._

                             THE SONG.

                    _The dark is my delight,                      220
                       So 'tis the nightingale's;
                     My music's in the night,
                       So is the nightingale's;
                     My body is but little,
                       So is the nightingale's;
                     I love to sleep 'gainst prickle,
                       So doth the nightingale._

  Thanks; buss; so. The night grows old; good rest.

  _Fra._ Rest to mine dear love; rest, and no long absence.       230

  _Free._ Believe me, not long.

  _Fra._ Sall ick not believe you long?

                                                [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Free._ O yes, come, _via!_[27]--away, boy--on!

                                      [_Exit, his Page lighting him._

      _Re-enter_ FREEVILL, _and seems to overhear_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Mal._ Is she unchaste--can such a one be damn'd?
  O love and beauty! ye two eldest seeds
  Of the vast chaos, what strong right you have
  Even in things divine--our very souls!

  _Free._ [_aside._] Wha, ha, ho! come, bird, come. Stand, peace!

  _Mal._ Are strumpets then such things so delicate?
  Can custom spoil what nature made so good?                      240
  Or is their custom bad? Beauty's for use--
  I never saw a sweet face vicious!
  It might be proud, inconstant, wanton, nice,
  But never tainted with unnatural vice.
  Their worst is, their best art is love to win--
  O that to love should be or shame, or sin!

  _Free._ [_aside._] By the Lord! he's caught! Laughter eternal!

  _Mal._ Soul, I must love her! Destiny is weak
  To my affection.--A common love!--
  Blush not, faint breast!                                        250
  That which is ever loved of most is best.
  Let colder eld the strong'st objections move,
  No love's without some lust, no life without some love.

  _Free._ Nay, come on, good sir; what, though the most
  odious spectacle the world can present be an immodest
  vulgar woman? yet, sir, for my sake----

  _Mal._ Well, sir, for your sake, I'll think better of them.

  _Free._ Do, good sir; and pardon me that have brought you in:
  You know the sight of vice augments the hate of sin.

  _Mal._ Hah! will you go home, sir; 'tis high bedtime?           260

  _Free._ With all my heart, sir; only do not chide me.
  I must confess----

  _Mal._ A wanton lover you have been.

  _Free._ O that to love should be or shame or sin!

  _Mal._ Say ye?

  _Free._ Let colder eld the strongest objections move!

  _Mal._ How's this?

  _Free._ No love's without some lust, no life without some love.
  Go your ways for an apostata! I believe my cast garment
  must be let out in the seams for you when all is
  done.                                                           270
  Of all the fools that would all man out-thrust,
  He that 'gainst Nature would seem wise is worst.

      _Outside_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOY'S _house, under_ BEATRICE'S
                             _window_.

      _Enter_ FREEVILL, _Pages with torches and Gentlemen with
                              music_.


  _Free._ The morn is yet but young. Here, gentlemen,
  This is my Beatrice' window--this the chamber
  Of my betrothèd dearest, whose chaste eyes,
  Full of loved sweetness and clear cheerfulness,
  Have gaged my soul to her enjoyings;
  Shredding away all those weak under-branches
  Of base affections and unfruitful heats.
  Here bestow your music to my voice.

                                                           [_A song._

                     _Enter_ BEATRICE _above_.

  Always a virtuous name to my chaste love!

  _Bea._ Loved sir,                                                10
  The honour of your wish return to you.
  I cannot with a mistress' compliment,
  Forcèd discourses, or nice art of wit,
  Give entertain to your dear-wishèd presence:
  But safely thus,--what hearty gratefulness,
  Unsullen silence, unaffected modesty,
  And an unignorant shamefastness can express,
  Receive as your protested due. 'Faith, my heart,
  I am your servant.
  O let not my secure simplicity                                   20
  Breed your mislike, as one quite void of skill;
  'Tis grace enough in us not to be ill.
  I can some good, and, faith, I mean no hurt;
  Do not then, sweet, wrong sober ignorance.
  I judge you all of virtue, and our vows
  Should kill all fears that base distrust can move.
  My soul, what say you--still you love?

  _Free._ Still!
  My vow is up above me, and, like time,
  Irrevocable: I am sworn all yours.
  No beauty shall untwine our arms, no face                        30
  In my eyes can or shall seem fair;
  And would to God only to me you might
  Seem only fair! Let others disesteem
  Your matchless graces, so might I safer seem;
  Envy I covet not. Far, far be all ostent--
  Vain boasts of beauties, soft joys, and the rest:
  He that is wise pants on a private breast.
  So could I live in desert most unknown,
  Yourself to me enough were populous;[28]
  Your eyes shall be my joys, my wine that still                   40
  Shall drown my often cares; your only voice
  Shall cast a slumber on my list'ning sense;
  You, with soft lip, shall only ope mine eyes
  And suck their lids asunder; only you
  Shall make me wish to live, and not fear death,
  So on your cheeks I might yield latest breath.
  O he that thus may live and thus shall die,
  May well be envied of a deity.[29]

  _Bea._ Dear, my loved heart, be not so passionate;
  Nothing extreme lives long.                                      50

  _Free._ But not to be extreme[30]--nothing in love's extreme--
  My love receives no mean.

  _Bea._ I give you faith; and, prithee, since, poor soul!
  I am so easy to believe thee, make it much more pity to
  deceive me!
  Wear this slight favour in my remembrance.

                                      [_Throweth down a ring to him._

  _Free._ Which, when I part from,
  Hope, the best of life, ever part from me.

  _Bea._ I take you and your word, which may ever live
  your servant. See, day is quite broke up--the best of
  hours.                                                           61

  _Free._ Good morrow, graceful mistress: our nuptial
  day holds.

  _Bea._ With happy constancy a wishèd day.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Free._ Myself and all content rest with you.

                        _Enter_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Mal._ The studious morn, with paler cheek, draws on
  The day's bold light. Hark how the free-born birds
  Carol their unaffected passions!

                                           [_The nightingales sing._

  Now sing they sonnets--thus they cry, We love!
  O breath of heaven! thus they, harmless souls,                   70
  Give entertain to mutual affects.
  They have no bawds, no mercenary beds,
  No polite restraints, no artificial heats,
  No faint dissemblings; no custom makes them blush,
  No shame afflicts their name. O you happy beasts!
  In whom an inborn heat is not held sin,
  How far transcend you wretched, wretched man,
  Whom national custom, tyrannous respects
  Of slavish order, fetters, lames his power,
  Calling that sin in us which in all things else                  80
  Is Nature's highest virtue.
  _O miseri quorum gaudia crimen habent!_
  Sure Nature against virtue cross doth fall,
  Or virtue's self is oft unnatural.
  That I should love a strumpet! I, a man of snow!
  Now, shame forsake me--whither am I fallen!
  A creature of a public use! my friend's love, too!
  To live to be a talk to men--a shame
  To my professed virtue! O accursed reason,
  How many eyes hast thou to see thy shame,                        90
  And yet how blind once to prevent defame!

  _Free._ _Diaboli virtus in lumbis est!_ Morrow, my
  friend. Come, I could make a tedious scene of this
  now; but what----Pah! thou art in love with a
  courtezan! Why, sir, should we loathe all strumpets,
  some men should hate their own mothers or sisters: a
  sin against kind, I can tell you.

  _Mal._ May it beseem a wise man to be in love?

  _Free._ Let wise men alone, 'twill beseem thee and me
  well enough.                                                    100

  _Mal._ Shall I not offend the vowe[d] band of our
  friendship?

  _Free._ What, to affect that which thy friend affected?
  By Heaven, I resign her freely; the creature and I
  must grow off; by this time she has assure[d]ly heard of
  my resolved marriage, and no question swears "God's
  sacrament, ten towsand divells." I'll resign, i'faith.

  _Mal._ I would but embrace her, hear her speak, and
  at the most, but kiss her.

  _Free._ O friend, he that could live with the smoke of
  roast-meat might live at a cheap rate!                          111

  _Mal._ I shall ne'er prove heartily received;
  A kind of flat ungracious modesty,
  An insufficient dulness stains my 'haviour.

  _Free._ No matter, sir; insufficiency and sottishness
  are much commendable in a most discommendable
  action: now could I swallow thee, thou hadst wont to
  be so harsh and cold: I'll tell thee,--hell and the prodigies
  of angry Jove are not so fearful to a thinking mind
  as a man without affection. Why, friend, philosophy
  and nature are all one; love is the centre in which all
  lines close, the common bond of being.                          122

  _Mal._ O but a chaste reservèd privateness,
  A modest continence!

  _Free._ I'll tell thee what, take this as firmest sense:--
  Incontinence will force a continence;
  Heat wasteth heat, light defaceth light,
  Nothing is spoiled but by his proper might.
  This is something too weighty for thy floor.

  _Mal._ But howsoe'er you shade it, the world's eye              130
  Shines hot and open on't;
  Lying, malice, envy, are held but slidings,
  Errors of rage, when custom and the world
  Calls lust a crime spotted with blackest terrors.

  _Free._ Where errors are held crimes, crimes are but errors.
  Along, sir, to her; she's an arrant strumpet; and a
  strumpet is a sarpego, venom'd gonorrhy to man--things
  actually possessed [_Offers to go out, and suddenly
  draws back_]--yet since thou art in love,--and again, as
  good make use of a statue--a body without a soul, a carcass
  three months dead--yet since thou art in love----

  _Mal._ Death, man! my destiny I cannot choose.                  142

  _Free._ Nay, I hope so. Again, they sell but only flesh,
  No jot affection; so that even in the enjoying,
  _Absentem marmoreamque putes_.[31] Yet since you needs
  must love----

  _Mal._ Unavoidable, though folly--worse than madness!

  _Free._ It's true; but since you needs must love, you
     must know this,--
  He that must love, a fool and he must kiss.

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  Master Cocledemoy, _ut vales, Domine_!                          150

  _Coc._ _Ago tibi gratias_, my worshipful friend, how does
  your friend?

  _Free._ Out, you rascal!

  _Coc._ Hang toasts, you are an ass; much o' your
  worship's brain lies in your calves; bread o' god, boy, I
  was at supper last night with a new-wean'd bulchin;
  bread o' god, drunk, horribly drunk--horribly drunk!
  there was a wench, one Frank Frailty, a punk, an honest
  polecat, of a clean instep, sound leg, smooth thigh, and
  the nimble devil in her buttock. Ah, feast o' grace!
  when saw you, Tysefew, or Master Caqueteur, that
  prattling gallant of a good draught, common customs,
  fortunate impudence, and sound fart?                            163

  _Free._ Away, rogue!

  _Coc._ Hang toasts, my fine boy, my companion as
  worshipful.

  _Mal._ Yes, I hear you are taken up with scholars and
  churchmen.

                  _Enter_ HOLIFERNES _the barber_.

  _Coc._ _Quanquam_[32] _te, Marce, fili_, my fine boy.

  _Hol._ Does[33] your worship want a barber-surgeon?             170

  _Free._ Farewell, knave; beware the Mulligrubs.

                                  [_Exeunt_ FREEVILL _and_ MALHEREUX.

  _Coc._ Let the Mulligrubs beware the knave. What, a
  barber-surgeon, my delicate boy?

  _Hol._ Yes, sir, an apprentice to surgery.

  _Coc._[34] 'Tis, my fine boy. To what bawdy-house doth
  your master belong? What's thy name?

  _Hol._ Holifernes Reinscure.

  _Coc._ Reinscure! Good Master Holifernes, I desire
  your further acquaintance; nay, pray ye be covered,
  my fine boy: kill thy itch, and heal thy scabs. Is thy
  master rotten?                                                  181

  _Hol._ My father, forsooth, is dead----

  _Coc._ _And laid in his grave.
  Alas! what comfort shall Peggy then have!_[35]

  _Hol._ None but me, sir; that's my mother's son, I
  assure you.

  _Coc._ Mother's son? A good witty boy, would live to
  read an homily well: and to whom are you going now?

  _Hol._ Marry, forsooth, to trim Master Mulligrub the
  vintner.                                                        190

  _Coc._ Do you know Master Mulligrub?

  _Hol._ My godfather, sir.

  _Coc._ Good boy: hold up thy chops. I pray thee do
  one thing for me: my name is Gudgeon.

  _Hol._ Good Master Gudgeon.

  _Coc._ Lend me thy basin, razor, and apron.

  _Hol._ O Lord, sir![36]

  _Coc._ Well spoken; good English. But what's thy
  furniture worth?

  _Hol._ O Lord, sir, I know not.                                 200

  _Coc._ Well spoken; a boy of a good wit: hold this
  pawn; where dost dwell?

  _Hol._ At the sign of the Three Razors, sir.

  _Coc._ A sign of good shaving, my catastrophonical fine
  boy. I have an odd jest to trim Master Mulligrub, for
  a wager; a jest, boy; a humour. I'll return thy things
  presently. Hold!

  _Hol._ What mean you, good Master Gudgeon?

  _Coc._ Nothing, faith, but a jest, boy: drink that; I'll
  recoil presently.                                               210

  _Hol._ You'll not stay long.

  _Coc._ As I am an honest man. The Three Razors?

  _Hol._ Ay, sir.

                                                  [_Exit_ HOLIFERNES.

  _Coc._ Good; and if I shave not Master Mulligrub, my
  wit has no edge, and I may[37] go cack in my pewter. Let
  me see,--a barber: my scurvy tongue will discover me:
  must dissemble, must disguise; for my beard, my false
  hair; for my tongue--Spanish, Dutch or Welsh--no, a
  Northern barber; very good. Widow Reinscure's man,
  well; newly entertain'd, right; so, hang toasts! all cards
  have white backs, and all knaves would seem to have
  white breasts: so proceed now, worshipful Cocledemoy.

  _Mar._ Nay, good sweet daughter, do not swagger so;
  you hear your love is to be married, true; he does cast
  you off, right; he will leave you to the world,--what then?
  though blue and white, black and green, leave you, may
  not red and yellow entertain you? is there but one
  colour in the rainbow?

  _Fra._ Grand grincome[38] on your sentences! God's
  sacrament, ten towsand divels take you!--you ha'
  brought mine love, mine honour, mine body, all to
  noting!                                                          10

  _Mar._ To nothing! I'll be sworn I have brought them
  to all the things I could; I ha' made as much o' your
  maidenhead--and you had been mine own daughter, I
  could not ha' sold your maidenhead oft'ner than I ha'
  done. I ha' sworn for you, God forgive me! I have
  made you acquainted with the Spaniard, Don Skirtoll,--with
  the Italian, Messer Beieroane,--with the Irish lord,
  S. Patrick,--with the Dutch merchant, Haunce Herkin
  Glukin Skellam Flapdragon,--and specially with the
  greatest French, and now lastly with this English, yet, in
  my conscience, an honest gentleman. And am I now
  grown one of the accursed with you for my labour? Is
  this my reward? Am I call'd bawd? Well, Mary Faugh,
  go thy ways, Mary Faugh; thy kind heart will bring thee
  to the hospital.                                                 25

  _Fra._ Nay, good naunt, you'll help me to an oder love,
  vil you not?

  _Mar._ Out, thou naughty belly! wouldst thou make
  me thy bawd?--thou'st best make me thy bawd. I ha'
  kept counsel for thee: who paid the apothecary,--was't
  not honest Mary Faugh? who redeem'd thy petticoat
  and mantle,--was't not honest Mary Faugh? who helped
  thee to thy custom,--not swaggering Ireland captains,
  nor of two-shilling inns-o'-court men,--but with honest
  flat-caps,[39] wealthy flat-caps, that pay for their pleasure
  the best of any men in Europe, nay, which is more, in
  London? And dost thou defy me, vile creature?                    37

  _Fra._ Foutra[40] pon you,--vitch, bawd, polecat,--paugh!
  Did not you praise Freevill to mine love?

  _Mar._ I did praise, I confess, I did praise him; I said
  he was a fool, an unthrift, a true whoremaster, I confess;
  a constant drab-keeper, I confess: but what, the wind is
  turn'd!

  _Fra._ It is, it is, vile woman!--reprobate woman!--naughty
  woman! it is: vat sall become of mine poor
  flesh now? mine body must turn Turk for twopence.
  O Divela, life o' mine art! ick sall be reveng'd!--do ten
  thousand hell damn me, ick sall have the rogue trote
  cut! and his love, and his friend, and all his affinity, sall
  smart! sall dye! sall hang! Now legion of devil seize
  him!--de gran pest, St. Anthony's fire, and de hot
  Neapolitan poc, rot him!                                         52

                 _Enter_ FREEVILL _and_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ Franceschina!

  _Fra._ O mine seet, dear'st, kindest, mine loving! O
  mine towsand, ten towsand, delicated, petty[41] seet art!

                                                   [_Cantat Gallicè._

  A[h] mine, a[h] dear leevest affection!

  _Free._ Why, monkey, no fashion in you! Give entertain
  to my friend.

  _Fra._ Ick sall make de most of you dat courtesy may.
  Aunt Mary, Mettre Faugh, stools, stools, for des gallants!
  _Mine mettre sing non oder song_,[42]--frolic, frolic, sir!--    61
  _but still complain me do her wrong_. Lighten your heart,
  sir; for _me did but kiss her_,--for me did but kiss her--and
  _so let go_. Your friend is very heavy; ick sall ne'er
  like such sad company.

  _Free._ No, thou delightest only in light company.

  _Fra._ By mine trot, he been very sad; vat ail you, sir?

  _Mal._ A tooth-ache, lady, a paltry rheum.

  _Fra._ De diet is very goot for de rheum.

  _Free._ How far off dwells the house-surgeon, Mary
  Faugh?                                                           71

  _Mar._ You are a profane fellow, i'faith; I little thought
  to hear such ungodly terms come from your lips.

  _Fra._ Pre de now, 'tis but a toy, a very trifle.

  _Free._ I care not for the value, Frank, but i'faith----

  _Fra._ I'fait, me must needs have it (dis is Beatrice'
  ring, oh could I get it!); seet, pre de now, as ever you
  have embraced me with a hearty arm, a warm thought,
  or a pleasing touch, as ever you will profess to love me,
  as ever you do wish me life, give me dis ring, dis little
  ring.                                                            81

  _Free._ Prithee be not uncivilly importunate; sha' not
  ha't; faith, I care not for thee, nor thy jealousy; sha'
  not ha't, i'faith.

  _Fra._ You do not love me. I hear of Sir Hubert
  Subboys' daughter, Mistress Beatrice. God's sacrament,
  ick could scratch out her eyes, and suck the holes!

  _Free._ Go; y' are grown a punk rampant!

  _Fran._ So, get thee gone; ne'er more behold min eyes,
  by thee made wretched!                                           90

  _Free._ Mary Faugh, farewell!--farewell, Frank!

  _Fra._ Sall I not ha' de ring?

  _Free._ No, by the Lord!

  _Fra._ By te Lord?

  _Free._ By the Lord!

  _Fra._ Go to your new blouze,--your unproved sluttery,--your
  modest mettre, forsooth!

  _Free._ Marry, will I, forsooth!

  _Fra._ Will you marry, forsooth?

  _Free._ Do not turn witch before thy time.--                    100
  With all my heart, sir, you will stay.

  _Mal._ I am no whit myself.  _Video meliora proboque_,
  But raging lust my fate all strong doth move;
  The gods themselves cannot be wise and love.

  _Free._ Your wishes to you!

                                                    [_Exit_ FREEVILL.

  _Mal._ Beauty entirely choice--

  _Fra._ Pray ye prove a man of fashion, and neglect
  the neglected.

  _Mal._ Can such a rarity be neglected?--can there be
  measure or sin in loving such a creature?

  _Fra._ O min poor forsaken heart!                               110

  _Mal._ I cannot contain,--he saw thee not that left thee.
  If there be wisdom, reason, honour, grace,
  Of any foolishly-esteemèd virtue,
  In giving o'er possession of such beauty,
  Let me be vicious, so I may be loved.
  Passion, I am thy slave; sweet, it shall be my grace,
  That I account thy love my only virtue:
  Shall I swear I am thy most vowèd servant?

  _Fra._ Mine vowed? Go! go! go! I cannot more of
  love. No! no! no! You bin all unconstant. O unfaithful
  men--tyrants--betrayers--de very enjoying us loseth
  us; and when you only ha' made us hateful, you only
  hate us. O mine forsaken heart!                                 123

  _Mal._ I must not rave. Silence and modesty two
  customary virtues. Will you be my mistress?

  _Fra._ Mettres? Ha! ha! ha!

  _Mal._ Will you lie with me?

  _Fra._ Lie with you? O no; you men will out-lie any
  woman; fait, me no more can love.

  _Mal._ No matter, let me enjoy your bed.                        130

  _Fra._ O! vile man, vat do you tinck on me? Do you
  take me to be a beast--a creature that for sense only
  will entertain love, and not only for love--love? O!
  brutish abomination!

  _Mal._ Why, then I pray thee love, and with thy love
  enjoy me----

  _Fra._ Give me reason to affect you. Will you swear
  you love me?

  _Mal._ So seriously, that I protest no office so dangerous--no
  deed so unreasonable--no cost so heavy, but I vow
  to the utmost tentation of my best being to effect it.          141

  _Fra._ Sall I, or can I trust again? O fool!
  How natural 'tis for us to be abused!
  Sall ick be sure that no satiety,
  No enjoying,
  Not time shall languish your affection?

  _Mal._ If there be ought in brain, heart, or hand,
  Can make you doubtless, I am your vow'd servant.

  _Fra._ Will you do one ting for me?

  _Mal._ Can I do it?                                             150

  _Fra._ Yes, yes; but ick do not love dis same Freevill.

  _Mal._ Well?

  _Fra._ Nay, I do hate him.

  _Mal._ So.

  _Fra._ By this kiss I hate him.

  _Mal._ I love to feel such oaths; swear again.

  _Fra._ No, no. Did you ever hear of any that loved at
  the first sight?

  _Mal._ A thing most proper.

  _Fra._ Now fait, I judge it all incredible until this hour
  I saw you: pretty fair-eyed yout, would you enjoy
  me?                                                             162

  _Mal._ Rather than my breath, even as my being.

  _Fra._ Vel! had ick not made a vow----

  _Mal._ What vow?

  _Fra._ O let me forget it; it makes us both despair!

  _Mal._ Dear soul, what vow?

  _Fra._ Ha, good morrow, gentle sir; endeavour to forget
  me, as I must be enforced to forget all men. Sweet
  mind rest in you.                                               170

  _Mal._ Stay, let not thy desire burst me. O my
  impatient heat endures no resistance--no protraction!
  there is no being for me but your sudden enjoying.

  _Fra._ I do not love Freevill.

  _Mal._ But what vow? what vow?

  _Fra._ So long as Freevill lives, I must not love.

  _Mal._ Then he--

  _Fra._ Must--

  _Mal._ Die!

  _Fra._ I [k]no[w] there is no such vehemence in your affects.   180
  Would I were anything, so he were not!

  _Mal._ Will you be mine when he is not?

  _Fra._ Will I? Dear, dear breast, by this most zealous
  kiss! but I will not persuade you; but if you hate him
  that I loathe most deadly; yet as you please--I'll
  persuade noting.

  _Mal._ Will you be only mine?

  _Fra._ Vill I? How hard 'tis for true love to dissemble.
  I am only yours.

  _Mal._ 'Tis as irrevocable as breath: he dies.                  190
  Your love!

  _Fra._ My vow,--not until he be dead;
  Which that I may be sure not to infringe,
  Dis token of his death sall satisfy:
  He has a ring, as dear as the air to him,
  His new love's gift; tat got and brought to me,
  I shall assurèd your professèd rest.

  _Mal._ To kill a man?

  _Fra._ O! done safely; a quarrel sudden pick'd,
  With an advantage strike--then bribe--a little coin,
  All's safe, dear soul; but I'll not set you on.                 200

  _Mal._ Nay, he is gone--the ring! Well, come, little
  more liberal of thy love.

  _Fra._ Not yet; my vow.

  _Mal._ O Heaven! there is no hell but love's prolongings.
  Dear, farewell.

  _Fra._ Farewell.
  Now does my heart swell high, for my revenge
  Has birth and form; first friend sall kill his friend.
  He dat survives I'll hang; besides de chaste
  Beatrice I'll vex. Only de ring;                                210
  Dat got, the world sall know the worst of evils:
  Woman corrupted is the worst of devils.

                                                [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Mal._ To kill my friend! O 'tis to kill myself!
  Yet man's but man's excrement--man breeding man
  As he does worms; or this, to spoil this nothing.

                                                         [_He spits._

  The body of a man is of the self-same mould[43]
  As ox or horse; no murder to kill these.
  As for that only part which makes us man,
  Murder wants power to touch't. O wit, how vile!
  How hellish art thou, when thou raisest nature                  220
  'Gainst sacred faith! Think more: to kill a friend
  To gain a woman! to lose a virtuous self
  For appetite and sensual end, whose very having
  Loseth all appetite, and gives satiety!
  That corporal end, remorse and inward blushings,
  Forcing us loathe the steam of our own heats;
  Whilst friendship closed in virtue, being spiritual,
  Tastes no such languishings, and moments' pleasure
  With much repentance; but like rivers flow,
  And further that they run they bigger grow.                     230
  Lord, how was I misgone! how easy 'tis to err,
  When passion will not give us leave to think!
  A learn'd, that is an honest man, may fear,
  And lust, and rage, and malice,[44] and anything,
  When he is taken uncollected suddenly:
  'Tis sin of cold blood, mischief with waked eyes,
  That is the damnèd and the truly[45] vice;
  Not he that's passionless, but he 'bove passion's wise.
  My friend shall know it all.

                            _A Tavern._

         _Enter_ Master MULLIGRUB _and_ Mistress MULLIGRUB,
                _she with a bag of money_.


  _Mistress Mul._ It is right, I assure you, just fifteen
  pounds.

  _Mul._ Well, Cocledemoy, 'tis thou putt'st me to this
  charge; but, and I catch thee, I'll charge thee with as
  many irons. Well, is the barber come? I'll be trimm'd,
  and then to Cheapside to buy a fair piece of plate, to
  furnish the loss. Is the barber come?

  _Mistress Mul._ Truth, husband, surely heaven is not
  pleased with our vocation. We do wink at the sins of
  our people. Our wines are protestants; and I speak
  it to my grief, and to the burthen of my conscience, we
  fry our fish with salt butter.                                   12

  _Mul._ Go, look to your business; mend the matter,
  and score false with a vengeance.

                                          [_Exit_ Mistress MULLIGRUB.

                _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY _like a barber_.

  Welcome, friend, whose man?

  _Coc._ Widow Reinscure's man; and shall please your
  good worship, my name's Andrew Shark.

  _Mul._ How does my godson, good Andrew?

  _Coc._ Very well, he's gone to trim Master Quicquid,
  our parson. Hold up your head.                                   20

  _Mul._ How long have you been a barber, Andrew?

  _Coc._ Not long, sir; this two year.

  _Mul._ What! and a good workman already. I dare
  scarce trust my head to thee.

  _Coc._ O, fear not; we ha' poll'd better men than you;
  we learn the trade very quickly. Will your good worship
  be shaven or cut?

  _Mul._ As you will. What trade didst live by before
  thou turnedst barber, Andrew?

  _Coc._ I was a pedlar in Germany; but my countrymen
  thrive better by this trade.                                     31

  _Mul._ What's the news, barber? thou art sometimes at
  court.

  _Coc._ Sometimes poll a page or so, sir.

  _Mul._ And what's the news? How do all my good
  lords and all my good ladies, and all the rest of my
  acquaintance?

  _Coc._ What an arrogant knave's this! I'll acquaintance
  ye! 'Tis cash!--[_He spieth the bag._]--Say ye, sir?

  _Mul._ And what news--what news, good Andrew?                    40

  _Coc._ Marry, sir, you know the Conduit at Greenwich,
  and the under-holes that spouts up water?

  _Mul._ Very well; I was wash'd there one day, and so
  was my wife--you might have wrung her smock, i'faith!
  But what o' those holes?

  _Coc._ Thus, sir. Out of those little holes, in the midst
  of the night, crawl'd out twenty-four huge, horrible, monstrous,
  fearful, devouring----

  _Mul._ Bless us!                                                 49

  _Coc._ Serpents, which no sooner were beheld, but they
  turn'd to mastiffs, which howl'd; those mastiffs instantly
  turn'd to cocks, which crowed; those cocks, in a moment,
  were changed to bears, which roar'd; which bears are at
  this hour to be yet seen in Paris Garden, living upon
  nothing but toasted cheese and green onions.

  _Mul._ By the Lord! and this may be, my wife and I
  will go see them. This portends something.

  _Coc._ [_aside._] Yes, worshipful fist,[46] thou'st feel what
  portends by and by.                                              59

  _Mul._ And what more news? You shave the world--especially
  you barber-surgeons--you know the ground of
  many things. You are cunning privy searchers: by the
  mass, you scour all. What more news?

  _Coc._ They say, sir, that twenty-five couple of Spanish
  jennets are to be seen, hand in hand, dance the old
  measures,[47] whilst six goodly Flaunders mares play to
  them on a noise[48] of flutes.

  _Mul._ O monstrous! this is a lie o' my word. Nay,
  and this be not a lie--I am no fool, I warrant--nay,
  make an ass of me once?                                          70

  _Coc._ Shut your eyes close--wink; sure, sir, this ball
  will make you smart.

  _Mul._ I do wink.

  _Coc._ Your head will take cold;

              [COCLEDEMOY _puts on a coxcomb on_ MULLIGRUB'S _head_.]

  I will put on your good worship's nightcap whilst I
  shave you. So, mum, hang toasts! Faugh, _via!_[49] sparrows
  must peck and Cocledemoy munch.                                  77

  _Mul._ Ha, ha, ha! Twenty-five couple of Spanish
  jennets to dance the old measures. Andrew makes my
  worship laugh, i'faith. Dost take me for an ass, Andrew?--dost
  know one Cocledemoy in town? He made me an
  ass last night, but I'll ass him! Art thou free, Andrew?
  Shave me well--I shall be one of the common council
  shortly--and then, Andrew--why, Andrew, Andrew,
  dost leave me in the suds?

                              CANTAT.

  Why, Andrew, I shall be blind with winking. Ha!
  Andrew--wife--Andrew, what means this? Wife!--my
  money, wife!                                                     88

                    _Enter_ Mistress MULLIGRUB.

  _Mistress Mul._ What's the noise with you? What ail
  you?

  _Mul._ Where's the barber?

  _Mistress Mul._ Gone. I saw him depart long since.
  Why, are not you trimm'd?

  _Mul._ Trimm'd! O wife! I am shaved. Did you
  take hence the money?

  _Mistress Mul._ I touch'd it not, as I am religious.

  _Mul._ O Lord! I have wink'd fair.

                        _Enter_ HOLIFERNES.

  _Hol._ I pray, godfather, give me your blessing.

  _Mul._ O Holifernes--O where's thy mother's Andrew?             100

  _Hol._ Blessing, godfather!

  _Mul._ The devil choke thee! where's Andrew, thy
  mother's man?

  _Hol._ My mother hath none such, forsooth.

  _Mul._ My money--fifteen pounds--plague of all Andrews!
  who was't trimm'd me?

  _Hol._ I know not, godfather; only one met me, as I
  was coming to you, and borrowed my furniture, as he
  said, for a jest' sake.

  _Mul._ What kind of fellow?                                     110

  _Hol._ A thick, elderly, stub-bearded fellow.

  _Mul._ Cocledemoy, Cocledemoy! Raise all the wise
  men in the street! I'll hang him with mine own hands!
  O wife! some _rosa solis_.[50]

  _Mistress Mul._ Good husband, take comfort in the
  Lord; I'll play the devil, but I'll recover it. Have a
  good conscience, 'tis but a week's cutting[51] in the term!

  _Mul._ O, wife! O, wife! O, Jack! how does thy
  mother? Is there any fiddlers in the house?

  _Mistress Mul._ Yes, Master Creak's[52] noise?                  120

  _Mul._ Bid 'em play, laugh, make merry; cast up my
  accounts, for I'll go hang myself presently. I will not
  curse, but a pox on Cocledemoy; he has poll'd and
  shaved me, he has trimm'd me!

                                                           [_Exeunt._

     [51] Mistress Mulligrub consoles her husband with the thought
     that in one week of term-time the fifteen pounds may be recovered
     by help of a little _sharping_ (in the way of adulterating the
     liquors, frothing the cans, &c.).

                              ACT III.


                              SCENE I.

               _Room in_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

         _Enter_ BEATRICE, CRISPINELLA _and_ Nurse PUTIFER.


  _Put._ Nay, good child o' love, once more Master Freevill's
  sonnet o' the kiss you gave him.

  _Bea._ Sha't, good nurse:

                                                            [_Sings._

            _Purest lips, soft banks of blisses,
             Self alone deserving kisses;
             O give me leave to_, &c.

  _Cri._ Pish! sister Beatrice, prithee read no more; my
  stomach o' late stands against kissing extremely.

  _Bea._ Why, good Crispinella?                                     9

  _Cri._ By the faith and trust I bear to my face, 'tis
  grown one of the most unsavoury ceremonies: body
  o' beauty! 'tis one of the most unpleasing injurious
  customs to ladies: any fellow that has but one nose on
  his face, and standing collar and skirts also lined with
  taffety sarcenet, must salute us on the lips as familiarly--Soft
  skins save us! there was a stub-bearded John-a-Stile
  with a ployden's face saluted me last day and struck his
  bristles through my lips; I ha' spent ten shillings in
  pomatum since to skin them again. Marry, if a nobleman
  or a knight with one lock visit us, though his unclean
  goose-turd-green[53] teeth ha' the palsy, his nostrils smell
  worse than a putrified marrowbone, and his loose beard
  drops into our bosom, yet we must kiss him with a cursy,
  a curse! for my part, I had as lieve they would break
  wind in my lips.                                                 25

  _Bea._ Fie, Crispinella, you speak too broad.

  _Cri._ No jot, sister; let's ne'er be ashamed to speak
  what we be not ashamed to think: I dare as boldly
  speak venery as think venery.

  _Bea._ Faith, sister! I'll begone if you speak so broad.

  _Cri._ Will you so? Now bashfulness seize you, we
  pronounce boldly, robbery, murder, treason, which
  deeds must needs be far more loathsome than an act
  which is so natural, just, and necessary, as that of procreation;
  you shall have an hypocritical vestal virgin
  speak that with close teeth publicly, which she will
  receive with open mouth privately; for my own part, I
  consider nature without apparel; without disguising of
  custom or compliment, I give thoughts words, and
  words truth, and truth boldness; she whose honest
  freeness makes it her virtue to speak what she thinks
  will make it her necessity to think what is good. I love
  no prohibited things, and yet I would have nothing
  prohibited by policy, but by virtue; for as in the fashion
  of time those books that are call'd in are most in sale
  and request,[54] so in nature those actions that are most
  prohibited are most desired.                                     47

  _Bea._ Good quick sister, stay your pace; we are
  private, but the world would censure you, for truly
  severe modesty is women's virtue.

  _Cri._ Fie, fie! virtue is a free, pleasant, buxom quality.
  I love a constant countenance well; but this froward
  ignorant coyness, sour austere lumpish uncivil privateness,
  that promises nothing but rough skins and
  hard stools; ha! fie on't, good for nothing but for
  nothing. Well, nurse, and what do you conceive of
  all this?                                                        57

  _Put._ Nay, faith, my conceiving days be done. Marry
  for kissing, I'll defend that; that's within my compass;
  but for my own part, here's Mistress Beatrice is to be
  married with the grace of God; a fine gentleman he is
  shall have her, and I warrant a strong; he has a leg like
  a post, a nose like a lion, a brow like a bull, and a
  beard of most fair expectation: this week you must
  marry him, and I now will read a lecture to you both,
  how you shall behave yourselves to your husbands the
  first month of your nuptial; I ha' broke my skull about
  it, I can tell you, and there is much brain in it.

  _Cri._ Read it to my sister, good nurse, for I assure
  you I'll ne'er marry.                                            70

  _Put._ Marry, God forfend, what will you do then?

  _Cri._ Faith, strive against the flesh. Marry! no,
  faith, husbands are like lots in the lottery: you may
  draw forty blanks before you find one that has any prize
  in him. A husband generally is a careless, domineering
  thing, that grows like coral, which as long as it is under
  water is soft and tender, but as soon as it has got his
  branch above the waves is presently hard, stiff, not to be
  bowed but burst; so when your husband is a suitor and
  under your choice, Lord how supple he is, how obsequious,
  how at your service, sweet lady! Once married,
  got up his head above, a stiff, crooked, nobby, inflexible
  tyrannous creature he grows; then they turn like water,
  more you would embrace the less you hold. I'll live
  my own woman, and if the worst come to the worst, I
  had rather prove a wag than a fool.                              86

  _Bea._ O, but a virtuous marriage.

  _Cri._ Virtuous marriage! there is no more affinity
  betwixt virtue and marriage than betwixt a man and his
  horse; indeed virtue gets up upon marriage sometimes,
  and manageth it in the right way; but marriage is of
  another piece, for as a horse may be without a man, and
  a man without a horse, so marriage, you know, is often
  without virtue, and virtue, I am sure, more oft without
  marriage. But thy match, sister--by my troth I think
  'twill do well; he's a well-shaped, clean-lipp'd gentleman,
  of a handsome, but not affected, fineness, a good
  faithful eye, and a well-humour'd cheek; would he did
  not stoop in the shoulders, for thy sake. See, here he is.

                  _Enter_ FREEVILL _and_ TYSEFEW.

  _Free._ Good day, sweet!                                        100

  _Cri._ Good morrow, brother! nay, you shall have my
  lip. Good morrow, servant!

  _Tyse._ Good morrow, sweet life!

  _Cri._ Life! dost call thy mistress life?

  _Tyse._ Life! yes, why not life?

  _Cri._ How many mistresses hast thou?

  _Tyse._ Some nine.

  _Cri._ Why then thou hast nine lives, like a cat.

  _Tyse._ Mew, you would be taken up for that.                    109

  _Cri._ Nay, good, let me still sit; we low statures love
  still to sit, lest when we stand we may be supposed to
  sit.

  _Tyse._ Dost not wear high cork shoes--chopines?[55]

  _Cri._ Monstrous ones: I am, as many other are,
  pieced above and pieced beneath.

  _Tyse._ Still the best part in the----

  _Cri._ And yet all will scarce make me so high as one
  of the giants'[56] stilts that stalks before my Lord Mayor's
  pageant:

  _Tyse._ By the Lord, so I thought 'twas for something
  Mistress Joyce jested at thy high insteps.                      121

  _Cri._ She might well enough, and long enough, before
  I would be ashamed of my shortness: what I made or
  can mend myself I may blush at; but what nature put
  upon me, let her be ashamed for me, I ha' nothing to do
  with it. I forget my beauty.

  _Tyse._ Faith, Joyce is a foolish bitter creature.

  _Cri._ A pretty mildewed wench she is.

  _Tyse._ And fair----

  _Cri._ As myself!                                               130

  _Tyse._ O you forget your beauty now.

  _Cri._ Troth, I never remember my beauty, but as some
  men do religion,--for controversy's sake.

  _Bea._ A motion,[57] sister.

  _Cri._ Nineveh,[58] Julius Cæsar, Jonas, or the destruction
  of Jerusalem.

  _Bea._ My love, hear.

  _Cri._ Prithee call him not love, 'tis the drab's phrase:
  nor sweet honey, nor my coney, nor dear duckling,
  they[59] are citizen terms, but call him----                    140

  _Bea._ What?

  _Cri._ Anything.--What's the motion?

  _Bea._ You know this night our parents have intended
  solemnly to contract us, and my love, to grace the feast,
  hath promised a masque.

  _Free._ You'll make one, Tysefew, and Caqueteur shall
  fill up a room.

  _Tyse._ 'Fore heaven, well-remember'd; he borrowed a
  diamond of me last night to grace his finger in your
  visitation. The lying creature will swear some strange
  thing on it now.                                                151

                    _Enter_ CAQUETEUR.

  _Cri._ Peace, he's here; stand close, lurk.

  _Caq._ Good morrow, most dear, and worthy to be
  most wise. How does my mistress?

  _Cri._ Morrow, sweet servant; you glister,--prithee,
  let's see that stone.

  _Caq._ A toy, lady, I bought to please my finger.

  _Cri._ Why, I am more precious to you than your
  finger.

  _Caq._ Yes, or than all my body, I swear.                       160

  _Cri._ Why, then let it be bought to please me; come,
  I am no professed beggar.

  _Caq._ Troth, mistress! Zoons! Forsooth, I protest!

  _Cri._ Nay, if you turn Protestant for such a toy.

  _Caq._ In good deed, la; another time I'll give you
  a----

  _Cri._ Is this yours to give?

  _Caq._ O God! forsooth mine, quoth you; nay, as for
  that----                                                        170

  _Cri._ Now I remember, I ha' seen this on my servant
  Tysefew's finger.

  _Caq._ Such another.

  _Cri._ Nay, I am sure this is it.

  _Caq._ Troth, 'tis forsooth. The poor fellow wanted
  money to pay for supper last night, and so pawn'd it to
  me; 'tis a pawn, i'faith, or else you should have it.

  _Tyse._ Hark ye, thou base lying--How dares thy impudence
  hope to prosper? Were't not for the privilege
  of this respected company, I would so bang thee.                180

  _Cri._ Come hither, servant. What's the matter betwixt
  you two?

  _Caq._ Nothing; but hark you, he did me some uncivil
  discourtesies last night; for which, because I should not
  call him to account, he desires to make me any satisfaction.
  The coward trembles at my very presence;
  but I ha' him on the hip; I'll take the forfeit on his
  ring.

  _Tyse._ What's that you whisper to her?                         189

  _Caq._ Nothing, sir; but satisfy her that the ring was
  not pawn'd, but only lent by you to grace my finger;
  and so told her I craved pardon for being too familiar,
  or indeed over-bold with your reputation.

  _Cri._ Yes, indeed, he did. He said you desired to
  make him any satisfaction for an uncivil discourtesy you
  did him last night; but he said he had you o' the hip,
  and would take the forfeit of your ring.

  _Tyse._ How now, ye base poltroon.

  _Caq._ Hold! hold! my mistress speaks by contraries.

  _Tyse._ Contraries!                                             200

  _Caq._ She jests--faith, only jests.

  _Cri._ Sir, I'll no more o' your service--you are a child--I'll
  give you to my nurse.

  _Put._ And he come to me, I can tell you, as old as I
  am, what to do with him.

  _Caq._ I offer my service, forsooth.

  _Tyse._ Why, so: now, every dog has his bone to
  gnaw on.

  _Free._ The masque holds, Master Caqueteur.

  _Caq._ I am ready, sir. Mistress, I'll dance with you,
  ne'er fear--I'll grace you.                                     211

  _Put._ I tell you, I can my singles and my doubles, and
  my trick o' twenty[60]--my carantapace--my traverse forward--and
  my falling back, yet, i'faith.

  _Bea._ Mine! The provision for the night is ours.
  Much must be our care; till night we leave you;
  I am your servant, be not tyrannous.
  Your virtue won me; faith, my love's not lust;
  Good, wrong me not; my most fault is much trust.

  _Free._ Until night only, my heart be with you. Farewell,
  sister.                                                         221

  _Cri._ Adieu, brother. Come on, sister, for these
  sweetmeats.

  _Free._ Let's meet and practise presently.

  _Tyse._ Content; we'll but fit our pumps. Come, ye
  pernicious vermin.

                                           [_Exeunt all but_ FREEVILL.

                   _Enter_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ My friend, wished hours! What news from Babylon?
  How does the woman of sin and natural concupiscence?

  _Mal._ The eldest child of nature ne'er beheld
  So damn'd a creature.                                           230

  _Free._ What! _In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas?_
  Which way bears the tide?

  _Mal._ Dear loved sir, I find a mind courageously
  vicious may be put on a desperate security; but can
  never be blessed with a firm enjoying and self-satisfaction.

  _Free._ What passion is this, my dear Lindabrides?[61]

  _Mal._ 'Tis well; we both may jest; I ha' been tempted
  to your death.

  _Free._ What, is the rampant cocatrice grown mad for
  the loss of her men?                                            241

  _Mal._ Devilishly mad.

  _Free._ As most assured of my second love?

  _Mal._ Right.

  _Free._ She would have had this ring.

  _Mal._ Ay, and this heart; and in true proof you were
  slain, I should bring her this ring, from which she was
  assured
  You would not part until from life you parted;
  For which deed, and only for which deed, I should
  possess her sweetness.                                          251

  _Free._ O! bloody villains! Nothing is defamed but
  by his proper self. Physicians abuse remedies; lawyers
  spoil the law; and women only shame women. You
  ha' vow'd my death?

  _Mal._ My lust, not I, before my reason would; yet I
  must use her. That I, a man of sense, should conceive
  endless pleasure in a body whose soul I know to be so
  hideously black!                                                259

  _Free._ That a man at twenty-three should cry, O sweet
  pleasure! and at forty-three should sigh, O sharp pox!
  But consider man furnished with omnipotence, and you
  overthrow him; thou must cool thy impatient appetite.
  'Tis fate, 'tis fate!

  _Mal._ I do malign my creation that I am subject to
  passion. I must enjoy her.

  _Free._ I have it, mark. I give a masque to-night
  To my love's kindred; in that thou shalt go.
  In that we two make show of falling out.
  Give seeming challenge--instantly depart,                       270
  With some suspicion to present fight.
  We will be seen as going to our swords;
  And after meeting, this ring only lent,
  I'll lurk in some obscure place, till rumour
  (The common bawd to loose suspicions)
  Have feign'd me slain, which (in respect myself
  Will not be found, and our late seeming quarrel)
  Will quickly sound to all as earnest truth.
  Then to thy wench; protest me surely dead;
  Show her this ring, enjoy her, and, blood cold,                 280
  We'll laugh at folly.

  _Mal._ O but think of it!

  _Free._ Think of it! come away; virtue, let sleep thy passions;
  What old times held as crimes, are now but fashions.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

             _House of_ Master BURNISH, _the jeweller_.

  _Enter_ Master BURNISH[62] _and_ LIONEL. Master MULLIGRUB, _with a
     standing cup in his hand, and an obligation[63] in the other_.
     COCLEDEMOY _stands at the other door, disguised like a French
     pedlar, and overhears them_.


  _Mul._ I am not at this time furnish'd; but there's my
  bond for your plate.

  _Bur._ Your bill had been sufficient: y'are a good[64]
  man. A standing cup parcel-gilt[65] of thirty-two ounces,
  eleven pounds seven shillings, the first of July. Good
  plate--good man--good day--good all.

  _Mul._ 'Tis my hard fortune; I will hang the knave.
  No, first he shall half rot in fetters in the dungeon--his
  conscience made despairful. I'll hire a knave o' purpose--shall
  assure him he is damn'd; and after see him with
  mine own eyes, hang'd without singing any psalm. Lord,
  that he has but one neck!                                        12

  _Bur._ You are too tyrannous;--you'll use me no
  further?

  _Mul._ No, sir; lend me your servant, only to carry the
  plate home. I have occasion of an hour's absence.

  _Bur._ With easy consent, sir.--Haste and be careful.

                                                     [_Exit_ BURNISH.

  _Mul._ Be very careful, I pray thee,--to my wife's own
  hands.

  _Lio._ Secure yourself, sir.                                     20

  _Mul._ To her own hand!

  _Lio._ Fear not, I have delivered greater things than
  this to a woman's own hand.

  _Coc._ Mounsier, please you to buy a fine delicate ball,
  sweet ball--a camphor ball?

  _Mul._ Prithee, away!

                                                      [_Exit_ LIONEL.

  _Coc._ Wun'[66] a ball to scour--a scouring ball--a ball to
  be shaved!

  _Mul._ For the love of God! talk not of shaving. I
  have been shaved--mischief and a thousand devils seize
  him!--I have been shaved!                                        31

  _Coc._ The fox grows fat when he is cursed--I'll shave
  ye smoother yet. Turd on a tile stone! my lips have a
  kind of rheum at this bole. I'll have't--I'll gargalise
  my throat with this vintner, and when I have done with
  him, spit him out. I'll shark! Conscience does not
  repine. Were I to bite an honest gentleman, a poor
  grogaran poet, or a penurious parson that had but ten
  pigs' tails in a twelvemonth, and, for want of learning, had
  but one good stool in a fortnight, I were damn'd beyond
  the works of supererogation; but to wring the withers of
  my gouty-barm'd spiggod-frigging jumbler of elements,
  Mulligrub, I hold it as lawful as sheep-shearing, taking
  eggs from hens, caudles from asses, or butter'd shrimps
  from horses--they make no use of them, were not provided
  for them. And, therefore, worshipful Cocledemoy,
  hang toasts! On, in grace and virtue to proceed,
  only beware, beware degrees. There be rounds in a
  ladder, and knots in a halter; ware carts, hang toasts,
  the common council has decreed it! I must draw a lot
  for the great goblet.                                            51

                            _A Tavern._

     _Enter_ Mistress MULLIGRUB, _and_ LIONEL _with a goblet_.


  _Mistress Mul._ Nay, I pray you, stay and drink; and
  how does your mistress? I know her very well--I have
  been inward with her, and so has many more. She was
  ever a good, patient creature, i'faith! With all my
  heart, I'll remember your master, an honest man. He
  knew me before I was married! An honest man he is,
  and a crafty. He comes forward in the world well, I
  warrant him; and his wife is a proper woman, that she
  is. Well, she has been as proper a woman as any in
  Cheap. She paints now, and yet she keeps her husband's
  old customers to him still. In troth, a fine-faced
  wife, in a wainscot-carved seat,[67] is a worthy ornament
  to a tradesman's shop, and an attractive, I warrant; her
  husband shall find it in the custom of his ware, I'll
  assure him. God be with you, good youth; I acknowledge
  the receipt. [_Exit_ LIONEL.] I acknowledge all the
  receipt--sure, 'tis very well spoken--I acknowledge the
  receipt. Thus 'tis to have good education, and to be
  brought up in a tavern. I do keep as gallant and as
  good company, though I say it, as any she in London.
  Squires, gentlemen, and knights diet at my table, and I
  do lend some of them money; and full many fine men
  go upon my score, as simple as I stand here, and I trust
  them; and truly they very knightly and courtly promise
  fair, give me very good words, and a piece of flesh when
  time of year serves. Nay, though my husband be a
  citizen, and's cap's made of wool,[68] yet I ha' wit, and
  can see my good as soon as another, for I have all the
  thanks; my silly husband, alas! he knows nothing of
  it; 'tis I that bear--'tis I that must bear a brain[69] for all.

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ Fair hour to you, mistress!                               31

  _Mistress Mul._ Fair hour!--fine term!--faith, I'll score
  it up anon.--A beautiful thought to you, sir.

  _Coc._ Your husband, and my master, Mr. Burnish,[70]
  has sent you a jole of fresh salmon, and they both will
  come to dinner to season your new cup with the best
  wine, which cup your husband entreats you to send back
  by me, that his arms may be graved a' the side, which
  he forgot before it was sent.

  _Mistress Mul._ By what token are you sent?--by no
  token? Nay, I have wit.                                          41

  _Coc._ He sent me by the same token, that he was dry
  shaved this morning.

  _Mistress Mul._ A sad token, but true. Here, sir, I
  pray you commend me to your master, but especially to
  your mistress. Tell them they shall be most sincerely
  welcome.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Coc._ Shall be most sincerely welcome! Worshipful
  Cocledemoy, lurk close. Hang toasts! Be not ashamed
  of thy quality! Every man's turd smells well in's own
  nose. Vanish, foyst!                                             51

                                                             [_Exit._

         _Re-enter_ Mistress MULLIGRUB, _with servants and
                     furniture for the table_.

  _Mistress Mul._ Come, spread these table diaper napkins,
  and--do you hear--perfume this parlour; does so
  smell of profane tobacco. I could never endure this
  ungodly tobacco, since one of our elders assured me,
  upon his knowledge, tobacco was not used in the congregation
  of the family of love. Spread, spread handsomely--Lord?
  these boys do things arsy-versy--you
  show your bringing up. I was a gentlewoman by my
  sister's side--I can tell ye so methodically. Methodically!
  I wonder where I got that word? O! Sir
  Aminadab Ruth bad me kiss him methodically!--I had
  it somewhere, and I had it indeed.                               63

                     _Enter_ Master MULLIGRUB.

  _Mul._ Mind, be not desperate; I'll recover all.
  All things with me shall seem honest that can be profitable,
  He must ne'er winch, that would or thrive or save,
  To be call'd niggard, cuckold, cut-throat, knave!

  _Mistress Mul._ Are they come, husband?

  _Mul._ Who?--what?--how now? What feast towards
  in my private parlour?                                           70

  _Mistress Mul._ Pray leave your foolery! What, are
  they come?

  _Mul._ Come--who come?

  _Mistress Mul._ You need not make't so strange!

  _Mul._ Strange?

  _Mistress Mul._ Ay, strange. You know no man that
  sent me word that he and his wife would come to dinner
  to me, and sent this jole of fresh salmon beforehand?

  _Mul._ Peace--not I--peace! The messenger hath
  mistaken the house; let's eat it up quickly before it be
  inquired for. Sit to it--some vinegar--quick! Some
  good luck yet. Faith, I never tasted salmon relish
  better! Oh! when a man feeds at other men's cost!                83

  _Mistress Mul._ Other men's cost! Why, did not you
  send this jole of salmon?

  _Mul._ No.

  _Mistress Mul._ By Master Burnish'[71] man?

  _Mul._ No.

  _Mistress Mul._ Sending me word that he and his wife
  would come to dinner to me?                                      90

  _Mul._ No, no.

  _Mistress Mul._ To season my new bowl?

  _Mul._ Bowl!

  _Mistress Mul._ And withal will'd me to send the bowl
  back.

  _Mul._ Back!

  _Mistress Mul._ That you might have your arms graved
  on the side?

  _Mul._ Ha!

  _Mistress Mul._ By the same token you were dry-shaven
  this morning before you went forth.                             101

  _Mul._ Pah! how this salmon stinks!

  _Mistress Mul._ And thereupon sent the bowl back,
  prepar'd dinner--nay, and I bear not a brain.

  _Mul._ Wife, do not vex me! Is the bowl gone?--is
  it deliver'd?

  _Mistress Mul._ Deliver'd! Yes, sure, 'tis deliver'd.

  _Mul._ I will never more say my prayers. Do not
  make me mad; 'tis common. Let me not cry like a
  woman. Is it gone?                                              110

  _Mistress Mul._ Gone? God is my witness, I deliver'd
  it with no more intention to be cozen'd on't than the
  child new born; and yet----

  _Mul._ Look to my house! I am haunted with evil
  spirits! Hear me; do hear me! If I have not my
  goblet again, heaven! I'll to the devil,--I'll to a conjurer.
  Look to my house! I'll raise all the wise men
  i' the street.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Mistress Mul._ Deliver us! What words are these? I
  trust in God he is but drunk, sure.                             120

                       _Re-enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ I must have the salmon too; worship[ful] Cocledemoy,
  now for the masterpiece. God bless thy neckpiece,
  and foutra!--Fair mistress, my master----

  _Mistress Mul._ Have I caught you?--what, Roger?

  _Coc._ Peace, good mistress. I'll tell you all. A jest;
  a very mere jest: your husband only took sport to
  fright you:--the bowl's at my master's; and there is
  your husband, who sent me in all haste lest you should
  be over-frighted with his feigning, to come to dinner to
  him.                                                            130

  _Mistress Mul._ Praise heaven it is no worse.

  _Coc._ And desired me to desire you to send the jole of
  salmon before, and yourself to come after to them; my
  mistress would be right glad to see you.

  _Mistress Mul._ I pray carry it.  Now thank them
  entirely. Bless me, I was never so out of my skin in
  my life! pray thank your mistress most entirely.

  _Coc._ So now, figo! worshipful Mall Faugh and I will
  munch; cheaters and bawds go together like washing
  and wringing.                                                   140

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Mistress Mul._ Beshrew his heart for his labour, how
  everything about[72] me quivers. What, Christian! my
  hat and aporn:[73] here, take my sleeves. And how I
  tremble! so I'll gossip it now for't, that's certain; here
  has been revolutions and false fires indeed.

                         _Enter_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Mul._ Whither now?--what's the matter with you now?--whither
  are you a-gadding?

  _Mistress Mul._ Come, come, play the fool no more.
  Will you go?

  _Mul._ Whither, in the rank name of madness--whither?

  _Mistress Mul._ Whither?--why to Master Burnish,[74] to
  eat the jole of salmon. Lord, how strange you make
  it!                                                             153

  _Mul._ Why so?--why so?

  _Mistress Mul._ Why so? Why, did not you send the
  self-same fellow for the jole of salmon that had the cup?

  _Mul._ 'Tis well,--'tis very well.

  _Mistress Mul._ And will'd me to come and eat it with
  you at the goldsmith's?

  _Mul._ O, ay, ay, ay,--art in thy right wits?                   160

  _Mistress Mul._ Do you hear?--make a fool of somebody
  else; and you make an ass of me, I'll make an ox
  of you,--do ye see?

  _Mul._ Nay, wife, be patient; for, look you, I may be
  mad, or drunk, or so; for my own part, though you can
  bear more than I, yet I can do well. I will not curse
  nor cry,[75] but Heaven knows what I think. Come, let's
  go hear some music; I will never more say my prayers.
  Let's go hear some doleful music. Nay, if Heaven forget
  to prosper knaves, I'll go no more to the synagogue.
  Now I am discontented, I'll turn sectary; that is fashion.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

               _Room in_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

          _Enter_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS, Sir LIONEL FREEVILL,
                CRISPINELLA; _servants with lights_.


  _Sir Hub._ More lights! Welcome, Sir Lionel Freevill!
  brother Freevill, shortly. Look to your lights!

  _Serv._ The masquers are at hand.

  _Sir Lio._ Call down our daughter. Hark! they are at
  hand: rank handsomely.

  _Enter the Masquers; they dance._ _Enter_ BEATRICE, FREEVILL,
     _and_ MALHEUREUX. MALHEUREUX _takes_ BEATRICE _from_ FREEVILL:
     _they draw_.

  _Free._ Know, sir, I have the advantage of the place;
  You are not safe: I would deal even with you.

  _Mal._ So.

                                  [_They exchange gloves as pledges._

  _Free._ So.

  _Bea._ I do beseech you, sweet, do not for me provoke
  your fortune.                                                    11

  _Sir Lio._ What sudden flaw is risen?

  _Sir Hub._ From whence comes this?

  _Free._ An ulcer, long time lurking, now is burst.

  _Sir Hub._ Good sir, the time and your designs are soft.

  _Bea._ Ay, dear sir, counsel him, advise him; 'twill relish well
  From your carving. Good my sweet, rest safe.

  _Free._ All's well! all's well!--this shall be ended straight.

  _Sir Hub._ The banquet stays;--there we'll discourse more large.

  _Free._ Marriage must not make men cowards.

  _Sir Lio._ Nor rage fools.                                       19

  _Sir Hub._ 'Tis valour not where heat but reason rules.

                    [_Exeunt; only_ TYSEFEW _and_ CRISPINELLA _stay_.

  _Tyse._ But do you hear, lady?--you proud ape, you!
  What was the jest you brake of me even now?

  _Cris._ Nothing. I only said you were all mettle;--that
  you had a brazen face, a leaden brain, and a copper
  beard.

  _Tyse._ Quicksilver,--thou little more than a dwarf,
  and something less than a woman.

  _Cris._ A wisp! a wisp! a wisp!--will you go to the
  banquet?

  _Tyse._ By the Lord, I think thou wilt marry shortly
  too; thou growest somewhat foolish already.                      31

  _Cris._ O, i'faith, 'tis a fair thing to be married, and a
  necessary. To hear this word _must_! If our husbands
  be proud, we must bear his contempt; if noisome, we
  must bear with the goat under his armholes; if a fool,
  we must bear his bable;[76] and, which is worse, if a
  loose liver, we must live upon unwholesome reversions;
  where, on the contrary side, our husbands--because
  they may, and we must--care not for us. Things
  hoped with fear, and got with strugglings, are men's high
  pleasures, when duty palls and flats their appetite.             41

  _Tyse._ What a tart monkey is this! By heaven! if
  thou hadst not so much wit, I could find in my heart
  to marry thee. Faith, bear with me for all this!

  _Cris._ Bear with thee? I wonder how thy mother
  could bear thee ten months in her belly, when I cannot
  endure thee two hours in mine eye.

  _Tyse._ Alas, for your sweet soul! By the Lord, you
  are grown a proud, scurvy, apish, idle, disdainful,
  scoffing--God's foot! because you have read _Euphues
  and his England_,[77] _Palmerin de Oliva_,[78] and the _Legend
  of Lies_![79]                                                    52

  _Cris._ Why, i'faith, yet, servant, you of all others
  should bear with my known unmalicious humours: I
  have always in my heart given you your due respect.
  And Heaven may be sworn, I have privately given fair
  speech of you, and protested----

  _Tyse._ Nay, look you; for my own part, if I have not
  as religiously vow'd my heart to you,--been drunk to
  your health, swallowed flap-dragons,[80] ate glasses, drunk
  urine,[81] stabb'd arms,[82] and done all the offices of protested
  gallantry for your sake; and yet you tell me I
  have a brazen face, a leaden brain, and a copper beard!
  Come, yet, and it please you.                                    64

  _Cris._ No, no;--you do not love me.

  _Tyse._ By ---- but I do now; and whosoever dares
  say that I do not love you, nay, honour you, and if you
  would vouchsafe to marry----

  _Cris._ Nay, as for that, think on't as you will, but
  God's my record,--and my sister knows I have taken
  drink and slept upon't,--that if ever I marry, it shall be
  you; and I will marry, and yet I hope I do not say it
  shall be you neither.                                            73

  _Tyse._ By Heaven, I shall be as soon weary of health
  as of your enjoying!--Will you cast a smooth cheek
  upon me?

  _Cris._ I cannot tell. I have no crump'd shoulders,
  my back needs no mantle, and yet marriage is honourable.
  Do you think ye shall prove a cuckold?

  _Tyse._ No, by the Lord, not I!                                  80

  _Cris._ Why, I thank you, i'faith. Heigho! I slept on
  my back this morning, and dreamt the strangest dreams.
  Good Lord! How things will come to pass! Will
  you go to the banquet?

  _Tyse._ If you will be mine, you shall be your own:--my
  purse, my body, my heart, is yours,--only be silent
  in my house, modest at my table, and wanton in my
  bed;--and the Empress of Europe cannot content, and
  shall not be contented, better.                                  89

  _Cris._ Can any kind heart speak more discreetly affectionately?
  My father's consent; and as for mine----

  _Tyse._ Then thus, and thus, so Hymen should begin;
  Sometimes a falling out proves falling in.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [76] The word is used in the double sense of (1) babble, (2)
     bauble (which was frequently written _bable_).

     [77] _Euphues and his England_ is the title of the second part
     (first published in 1580) of John Lyly's famous and tedious
     romance.

     [78] One of the romances published in the series that bears the
     general title of _The Mirrour of Knighthood_.

     [79] The _Legend of Lies_ is, of course, a fictitious book.

     [80] Candle-ends floating in lighted brandy.

     [81] This nasty feat of gallantry is mentioned by Middleton, ii.
     351.

     [82] It appears (from passages in Ben Jonson, Middleton, &c.)
     that gallants were accustomed to puncture their arms, and letting
     the blood drip into the wine, drink off the mixture to their
     mistress' health.


                             SCENE II.

                _Near_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

      _Enter_ FREEVILL, _speaking to some within_; MALHEUREUX
                        _at the other door_.


  _Free._ As you respect my virtue, give me leave
  To satisfy my reason, though not blood.--
  So all runs right; our feignèd rage hath ta'en
  To fullest life: they are much possess'd
  Of force most, most all quarrel. Now, my right friend,
  Resolve me with open breast, free and true heart;
  Cannot thy virtue, having space to think
  And fortify her weakened powers with reason,
  Discourses, meditations, discipline,
  Divine ejaculatories, and all those aids against devils,--
  Cannot all these curb thy low appetite                           11
  And sensual fury?

  _Mal._ There is no God in blood, no reason in desire.
  Shall I but live? Shall I not be forced to act
  Some deed whose very name is hideous?

  _Free._ No.

  _Mal._ Then I must enjoy Franceschina.

  _Free._ You shall.
  I'll lend this ring: show it to that fair devil:
  It will resolve me dead;
  Which rumour, with my artificial absence,
  Will make most firm: enjoy her suddenly.                         20

  _Mal._ But if report go strong that you are slain,
  And that by me,--whereon I may be seized,--
  Where shall I find your being?

  _Free._ At Master Shatewe's the jeweller's, to whose breast
  I'll trust our secret purpose.

  _Mal._ Ay, rest yourself;
  Each man hath follies.

  _Free._ But those worst of all,
  Who, with a willing eye, do seeing fall.

  _Mal._ 'Tis true, but truth seems folly in madness'
  spectacles. I am not now myself, no man: farewell.

  _Free._ Farewell.                                                30

  _Mal._ When woman's in the heart, in the soul hell.

                                                  [_Exit_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ Now, repentance, the fool's whip, seize thee;
  Nay, if there be no means I'll be thy friend,
  But not thy vices'; and with greatest sense
  I'll force thee feel thy errors to the worst;
  The wildest of dangers thou shalt sink into.
  No jeweller shall see me; I will lurk
  Where none shall know or think; close I'll withdraw,
  And leave thee with two friends--a whore and knave;
  But is this virtue in me? No, not pure,                          40
  Nothing extremely best with us endures;
  No use in simple purities; the elements
  Are mix'd for use; silver without allay[83]
  Is all too eager[84] to be wrought for use:
  Nor precise virtues, ever purely good,
  Holds useful size with temper of weak blood.
  Then let my course be borne, though with side-wind;
  The end being good, the means are well assign'd.

                     _Franceschina's lodging._

           _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA _melancholy_, COCLEDEMOY
                           _leading her_.


  _Coc._ Come, catafugo, Frank o' Frank-hall! who, who
  ho! Excellent! Ha, here's a plump-rump'd wench,
  with a breast softer than a courtier's tongue, an old
  lady's gums, or an old man's _mentula_. My fine
  rogue----

  _Fra._ Pah, you poltroon!

  _Coc._ Goody fist,[85] flumpum pumpum; ah, my fine wag-tail,
  thou art as false, as prostituted, and adulterate as
  some translated manuscript. Buss, fair whore, buss!

  _Fra._ God's sacrament, pox!                                     10

  _Coc._ _Hadamoy key_, dost thou frown, _medianthon
  teukey_? Nay, look here._ Numeron key_, silver _blithefor
  cany, os cany_ goblet: _us key ne moy blegefoy oteeston pox_,
  on you gosling!

  _Fra._ By me fait, dis bin very fine langage; ick sall
  bush ye now; ha, be garzon, vare had you dat plate?

  _Coc._ _Hedemoy key_, get you gone, punk rampant, _key_,
  common up-tail!

                   _Enter_ MARY FAUGH _in haste_.

  _Mar._ O daughter, cousin, niece, servant, mistress!

  _Coc._ Humpum, plumpum squat, I am gone.                         20

                                                  [_Exit_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Mar._ There is one Master Malheureux at the door
  desires to see you. He says he must not be denied,
  for he hath sent this ring; and withal says 'tis done.

  _Fra._ Vat sall me do now, God's sacrament! Tell him
  two hours hence he sall be most affectionately velcome;
  tell him (vat sall me do?), tel him ick am bin in my bate,
  and ick sall perfume my feets, mak a mine body so delicate
  for his arm, two hours hence.

  _Mar._ I shall satisfy him: two hours hence, well.               29

                                                        [_Exit_ MARY.

  _Fra._ Now ick sall revange; hay, begar, me sal tartar
  de whole generation! Mine brain vork it. Freevill is
  dead, Malheureux sall hang; and mine rival, Beatrice,
  ick sall make run mad.

                        _Enter_ MARY FAUGH.

  _Mar._ He's gone, forsooth, to eat a caudle of cock-stones,
  and will return within this two hours.

  _Fra._ Verie vel, give monies to some fellow to squire
  me; ick sal go abroad.

  _Mar._ There's a lusty bravo beneath, a stranger, but a
  good stale[86] rascal. He swears valiantly, kicks a bawd
  right virtuously, and protests with an empty pocket right
  desperately. He'll squire you.                                   41

  _Fra._ Very velcom; mine fan; ick sall retorn presantly.
  Now sal me be revange; ten tousant devla! der sall be
  no got in me but passion, no tought but rage, no mercy
  but bloud, no spirit but divla in me. Dere sal noting
  tought good for me, but dat is mischievous for others.

                             SCENE IV.

               _Room in_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

       _Enter_ Sir HUBERT, Sir LIONEL, BEATRICE, CRISPINELLA,
                 _and_ Nurse, TYSEFEW _following_.


  _Sir Lio._ Did no one see him since?--pray God!--nay, all is well.
  A little heat; what? he is but withdrawn;
  And yet I would to God!--but fear you nothing.

  _Bea._ Pray God that all be well, or would I were not!

  _Tyse._ He's not to be found, sir, anywhere.

  _Sir Lio._ You must not make a heavy face presage an
  ill event. I like your sister well, she's quick and lively:
  would she would marry, faith.

  _Cri._ Marry, nay and I would marry, methinks an old
  man's a quiet thing.                                             10

  _Sir Lio._ Ha, mass! and so he is.

  _Cri._ You are a widower?

  _Sir Lio._ That I am, i'faith, fair Crisp; and I can tell
  you, would you affect me, I have it in me yet, i'faith.

  _Cri._ Troth I am in love; let me see your hand:
  would you cast yourself away upon me willingly?

  _Sir Lio._ Will I? Ay, by the----

  _Cri._ Would you be a cuckold willingly? By my
  troth 'tis a comely, fine, and handsome sight, for one of
  my years to marry an old man; truth, 'tis restorative;
  what a comfortable thing it is to think of her husband,
  to hear his venerable cough o' the everlastings, to feel
  his rough skin, his summer hands and winter legs, his
  almost no eyes, and assuredly no teeth; and then to
  think what she must dream of, when she considers
  others' happiness and her own want! 'tis a worthy and
  notorious comfortable match.                                     27

  _Sir Lio._ Pish, pish! will you have me?

  _Cri._ Will you assure me----

  _Sir Lio._ Five hundred pound jointure?

  _Cri._ That you will die within this fortnight?

  _Sir Lio._ No, by my faith, Cris.

  _Cri._ Then Crisp by her faith assures you she'll have
  none of you.

       _Enter_ Young FREEVILL _disguised like a pander, and_
                           FRANCESCHINA.

  _Free._ By'r leave, gentles and men of nightcaps, I would
  speak, but that here stands one is able to express her
  own tale best.

  _Fra._ Sir, mine speech is to you; you had a son,
  matre Freevill?

  _Sir Lio._ Had, ha! and have.                                    40

  _Fra._ No point,[87] me am come to assure you dat one
  mestre Malheureux hath killed him.

  _Bea._ O me! wretched, wretched!

  _Sir Hub._ Look to our daughter.

  _Sir Lio._ How art thou inform'd?

  _Fra._ If dat it please you to go vid me, ick sall bring
  you where you sall hear Malheureux vid his own lips
  confess it, and dare ye may apprehend him, and revenge
  your and mine love's blood.

  _Sir Hub._ Your love's blood! mistress, was he your
  love?                                                            51

  _Fra._ He was so, sir; let your daughter hear it: do
  not veep, lady; de young man dat be slain did not love
  you, for he still lovit me ten tousant tousant times more
  dearly.

  _Bea._ O my heart, I will love you the better; I cannot
  hate what he affected. O passion, O my grief! which
  way wilt break, think, and consume!

  _Cri._ Peace!

  _Bea._ Dear woes cannot speak.                                   60

  _Fra._ For look you, lady, dis your ring he gave me,
  vid most bitter jests at your scorn'd kindness.

  _Bea._ He did not ill not to love me, but sure he did
  not well to mock me: gentle minds will pity, though
  they cannot love; yet peace and my love sleep with him.
  Unlace, good nurse; alas! I was not so ambitious of so
  supreme an happiness, that he should only love me;
  'twas joy enough for me, poor soul, that I only might
  only love him.

  _Fra._ O but to be abused, scorn'd, scoff'd at! O ten
  tousand divla, by such a one, and unto such a one!               71

  _Bea._ I think you say not true, sister; shall we know
  one another in the other world?

  _Cri._ What means my sister?

  _Bea._ I would fain see him again! O my tortured mind!
  Freevill is more than dead, he is unkind!

                        [_Exeunt_ BEATRICE, CRISPINELLA, _and_ Nurse.

  _Sir Hub._ Convey her in, and so, sir, as you said,
  Set a strong watch.

  _Sir Lio._ Ay, sir, and so pass along with this same common
  woman; you must make it good.                                    80

  _Fra._ Ick sall, or let me pay for his mine bloud.

  _Sir Hub._ Come, then, along all, with quiet speed.

  _Sir Lio._ O fate!

  _Tyse._ O sir, be wisely sorry, but not passionate.

                                    [_Exeunt all but_ Young FREEVILL.

  _Free._ I will go and reveal myself! stay, no, no;
  Grief endears love. Heaven! to have such a wife
  Is happiness to breed pale envy in the saints.
  Thou worthy dove-like virgin without gall,
  Cannot (that woman's evil) jealousy,
  Despite disgrace, nay, which is worse, contempt,                 90
  Once stir thy faith? O truth, how few sisters hast thou!
  Dear memory!
  With what a suffering sweetness, quiet modesty,
  Yet deep affection, she received my death!
  And then with what a patient, yet oppressed kindness,
  She took my lewdly intimated wrongs!
  O the dearest of heaven! were there but three
  Such women in the world, two might be saved.
  Well, I am great
  With expectation to what devilish end                           100
  This woman of foul soul will drive her plots;
  But Providence all wicked art o'ertops;
  And impudence must know (tho' stiff as ice),
  That fortune doth not always dote on vice.

                                                             [_Exit._

                              SCENE V.

                            _A Street._

       _Enter_ Sir HUBERT, Sir LIONEL, TYSEFEW, FRANCESCHINA,
                     _and three with halberds_.


  _Sir Hub._ Plant a watch there! be very careful, sirs;
  the rest with us.

  _Tyse._ The heavy night grows to her depth of quiet;
  'Tis about mid-darkness.

  _Fra._ Mine shambre is hard by; ick sall bring you to
  it presantment.

  _Sir Lio._ Deep silence! On!

                                                           [_Exeunt._

  _Coc._ (_within_). Wa, ha, ho!

                         _Enter_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Mul._ It was his voice, 'tis he: he sups with his
  cupping-glasses. 'Tis late; he must pass this way: I'll
  ha' him--I'll ha' my fine boy, my worshipful Cocledemoy;
  I'll moy him; he shall be hang'd in lousy
  linen; I'll hire some sectary to make him an heretic
  before he die; and when he is dead I'll piss on his
  grave.                                                           15

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ Ah, my fine punks, good night, Frank Frailty,
  Frail o' Frail-hall! _Bonus noches, my ubiquitari._

  _Mul._ Ware polling and shaving, sir.

  _Coc._ A wolf, a wolf, a wolf!

                  [_Exit_ COCLEDEMOY, _leaving his cloak behind him_.

  _Mul._ Here's something yet, a cloak, a cloak! Yet
  I'll after; he cannot 'scape the watch; I'll hang him if
  I have any mercy. I'll slice him.

                                                             [_Exit._

          _Enter three_ Constables; _to them_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _1st Con._ Who goes there? Come before the constable.            24

  _Coc._ Bread o' God! constable, you are a watch for
  the devil. Honest men are robb'd under your nose;
  there's a false knave in the habit of a vintner set upon
  me; he would have had my purse, but I took me to my
  heels: yet he got my cloak, a plain stuff cloak, poor,
  yet 'twill serve to hang him. 'Tis my loss, poor man
  that I am!                                                       31

                                                             [_Exit._

       _Enter_ MULLIGRUB _running with_ COCLEDEMOY'S _cloak_.

  _2d Con._ Masters, we must watch better; is't not
  strange that knaves, drunkards, and thieves should be
  abroad, and yet we of the watch, scriveners, smiths, and
  tailors, never stir?

  _1st Con._ Hark, who goes there?

  _Mul._ An honest man and a citizen.

  _2d Con._ Appear, appear; what are you?

  _Mul._ A simple vintner.

  _1st Con._ A vintner ha! and simple; draw nearer,
  nearer; here's the cloak.                                        41

  _2d Con._ Ay, Master Vintner, we know you: a plain
  stuff cloak; 'tis it.

  _1st Con._ Right, come! O thou varlet, dost not thou
  know that the wicked cannot 'scape the eyes of the
  constable?

  _Mul._ What means this violence? As I am an honest
  man I took the cloak----

  _1st Con._ As you are a knave, you took the cloak, we
  are your witnesses for that.                                     50

  _Mul._ But, hear me, hear me! I'll tell you what I am.

  _2d Con._ A thief you are.

  _Mul._ I tell you my name is Mulligrub.

  _1st Con._ I will grub you. In with him to the stocks;
  there let him sit till to-morrow morning, that Justice
  Quodlibet may examine him.

  _Mul._ Why, but I tell thee----

  _2d Con._ Why, but I tell thee, we'll tell thee now.

  _Mul._ Am I not mad? am I not an ass? Why, scabs,
  God's-foot! let me out.                                          60

  _2d Con._ Ay, ay, let him prate; he shall find matter
  in us scabs, I warrant: God's-so, what good members
  of the commonwealth do we prove!

  _1st Con._ Prithee, peace; let's remember our duties,
  and let's[88] go sleep, in the fear of God.

                    [_Exeunt, having left_ MULLIGRUB _in the stocks_.

  _Mul._ Who goes there? Illo, ho, ho: zounds, shall I
  run mad--lose my wits! Shall I be hang'd? Hark;
  who goes there? Do not fear to be poor, Mulligrub;
  thou hast a sure stock now.

              _Re-enter_ COCLEDEMOY _like a bellman_.

  _Coc._ The night grows old,                                      70
  And many a cuckold
  Is now--Wha, ha, ha, ho!
  Maids on their backs
  Dream of sweet smacks,
  And warm--Wo, ho, ho, ho!
  I must go comfort my venerable Mulligrub, I must
  fiddle him till he fist.[89] Fough!
  Maids in your night-rails,
  Look well to your light--
  Keep close your locks,                                           80
  And down your smocks;
  Keep a broad eye,
  And a close thigh.
  Excellent, excellent! Who's there? Now, Lord, Lord--Master
  Mulligrub--deliver us! what does your worship
  in the stocks? I pray come out, sir.

  _Mul._ Zounds, man, I tell thee I am lock'd!

  _Coc._ Lock'd! O world! O men! O time! O night!
  that canst not discern virtue and wisdom, and one of
  the common council! What is your worship in for?                 90

  _Mul._ For (a plague on't) suspicion of felony.

  _Coc._ Nay, and it be such a trifle, Lord, I could weep,
  to see your good worship in this taking. Your worship
  has been a good friend to me, and tho' you have forgot
  me, yet I knew your wife before she was married, and
  since I have found your worship's door open, and I
  have knock'd, and God knows what I have saved: and
  do I live to see your worship stocked?

  _Mul._ Honest bellman, I perceive
  Thou knowest me: I prithee call the watch.                      100
  Inform the constable of my reputation,
  That I may no longer abide in this shameful habitation,
  And hold thee all I have about me.

                                              [_Gives him his purse._

  _Coc._ 'Tis more than I deserve, sir: let me alone for
  your delivery.

  _Mul._ Do, and then let me alone with Cocledemoy.
  I'll moy him!

                     _Re-enter the_ Constables.

  _Coc._ Maids in your----
  Master Constable, whose that ith' stocks?

  _1st Con._ One for a robbery: one Mulligrub, he calls
  himself. Mulligrub? Bellman, knowest thou him?                  111

  _Coc._ Know him! O, Master Constable, what good
  service have you done! Know him? He's a strong
  thief; his house has been suspected for a bawdy tavern
  a great while, and a receipt for cut-purses, 'tis most
  certain. He has been long in the black book, and is he
  ta'en now?

  _2d Con._ By'r lady, my masters, we'll not trust the
  stocks with him, we'll have him to the justices, get a
  _mittimus_ to Newgate presently. Come, sir, come on,
  sir.                                                            121

  _Mul._ Ha! does your rascalship yet know my worship
  in the end?

  _1st Con._ Ay, the end of your worship we know.

  _Mul._ Ha! goodman constable, here's an honest fellow
  can tell you what I am?

  _2d Con._ 'Tis true, sir; y'are a strong thief, he says,
  on his own knowledge. Bind fast, bind fast! we know
  you. We'll trust no stocks with you. Away with him
  to the jail instantly.                                          130

  _Mul._ Why, but dost hear? Bellman, rogue, rascal!
  God's--why, but--

                               [_The Constables drag away_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Coc._ Why, but! wha, ha, ha! excellent, excellent!
  ha, my fine Cocledemoy, my vintner fists. I'll make
  him fart crackers before I ha' done with him; to-morrow
  is the day of judgment. Afore the Lord God, my
  knavery grows unperegall;[90] 'tis time to take a nap, until
  half an hour hence. God give your worship music,
  content, and rest.

                              SCENE I.

                     _Franceschina's lodging._

         _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA, Sir _LIONEL_, TYSEFEW, _with
                             Officers_.


  _Fra._ You bin very velcom to mine shambra.

  _Sir Lio._ But, how know ye, how are ye assured,
  Both of the deed, and of his sure return?

  _Fra._ O min-here, ick sall tell you. Metre Malheureux
  came all bretless running a my shambra, his sword all
  bloudy: he tel a me he had kil Freevill, and pred a me
  to conceal him. Ick flatter him, bid bring monies, he
  should live and lie vid me. He went, whilst ick (me
  hope vidout sins), out of mine mush love to Freevill,
  betray him.                                                      10

  _Sir Lio._ Fear not, 'tis well: good works get grace for
  sin.

                             [_She conceals them behind the curtain._

  _Fra._ Dere, peace, rest dere; so, softly, all go in.--
  De net is lay, now sal ick be revenge.
  If dat me knew a dog dat Freevill love,
  Me would puisson him; for know de deepest hell
  As a revenging woman's naught so fell.

                        _Enter_ MARY FAUGH.

  _Mar._ Ho! Cousin Frank, the party you wot of,
  Master Malheureux--

  _Fra._ Bid him come up, I prede.

                                    [_Cantat saltatque cum cithara._

                        _Enter_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Fra._ O min-here man, a dere liver love,                        20
  Mine ten tousant times velcom love!
  Ha! by mine trat, you bin de just--vat sall me say?
  Vat seet honie name sall I call you?

  _Mal._ Any from you
  Is pleasure. Come, my loving prettiness,
  Where's thy chamber? I long to touch your sheets.

  _Fra._ No, no, not yet, mine seetest soft-lipp'd love,
  You sall not gulp down all delights at once.
  Be min trat, dis all-fles-lovers, dis ravenous wenchers[91]
  dat sallow all down hole, vill have all at one bit; fie, fie,
  fie! be min fait, dey do eat comfets vid spoons.                 31
  No, no, I'll make you chew your pleasure vit love;
  De more degrees and steps, de more delight,
  De more endearèd is de pleasure height.

  _Mal._ What, you're a learn'd wanton, and proceed by art?

  _Fra._ Go, little vag, pleasure should have a crane's long
  neck, to relish de ambrosia of delight. And ick pre de
  tell me, for me loves to hear of manhood very mush,
  i'fait: ick prede--vat vas me a saying? Oh, ick prede
  tell a me how did you killa Metre Freevill?                      40

  _Mal._ Why, quarrelled o' set purpose, drew him out,
  Singled him, and, having the advantage
  Of my sword and might, ran him through and through.

  _Fra._ Vat did you vid him van he was sticken?

  _Mal._ I dragg'd him by the heels to the next wharf,
  And spurn'd him in the river.

                       [_Those in ambush rusheth forth and take him._

  _Sir Lio._ Seize, seize him!
  O monstrous! O ruthless villain!

  _Mal._ What mean you, gentlemen? By heaven----

  _Tyse._ Speak not of anything that's good.                       49

  _Mal._ Your errors gives you passion: Freevill lives.

  _Sir Lio._ Thy own lips say thou liest.

  _Mal._ Let me die, if at Shatewe's the jeweller he lives
  not safe untouch'd.

  _Tyse._ Meantime to strictest guard, to sharpest prison.

  _Mal._ No rudeness, gentlemen: I'll go undragg'd.
  O, wicked, wicked devil!

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Sir Lio._ Sir, the day of trial is this morn; let's prosecute
  The sharpest rigour and severest end:
  Good men are cruel when they're vice's friend.

  _Sir Hub._ Woman, we thank thee with no empty hand;
  Strumpets are fit[92] for something. Farewell.                   61

                                 [_All save_ Young FREEVILL _depart_.

  _Free._ Ay, for hell!
  O, thou unreprievable, beyond all
  Measure of grace damn'd irremediably![93]
  That things of beauty created for sweet use,
  Soft comfort, as[94] the very music of life,
  Custom should make so unutterably[95] hellish!
  O, heaven!
  What difference is in women and their life!
  What man, but worthy name of man, would leave                    70
  The modest pleasures of a lawful bed--
  The holy union of two equal hearts
  Mutually holding either dear as health--
  Th' undoubted issues, joys of chaste sheets,
  Th' unfeign'd embrace of sober ignorance--
  To twine th' unhealthful loins of common loves,
  The prostituted impudence of things,
  Senseless like those by cataracts of Nile,
  Their use so vile takes away sense! How vile
  To love a creature made of blood and hell,                       80
  Whose use makes weak, whose company doth shame,
  Whose bed doth beggar, issue doth defame!

                      _Re-enter_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Fra._ Metre Freevill live? ha, ha, live at Mestre
  Shatewe's! Mush[96] at Metre Shatewe's! Freevill is dead,
  Malheureux sall hang: and, sweet divel, dat Beatrice
  would but run mad, dat she would but run mad! den me
  would dance and sing. Metre Don Dubon, me pre ye
  now go to Mestres Beatrice. Tell her Freevill is sure
  dead, and dat he curse herself especially, for dat he was
  sticked in her quarrel, swearing in his last gasp, dat if it
  had bin in mine quarrels 'twould never have grieved him.

  _Free._ I will.                                                  92

  _Fra._ Prede do, and say any ting dat vil vex her.

  _Free._ Let me alone to vex her.

  _Fra._ Vil you, vil you mak a her run mad? Here,
  take dis ring, see me scorn to wear anyting dat was hers
  or his. I prede torment her, ick cannot love her; she
  honest and virtuous, forsooth!

  _Free._ Is she so? O vile creature! then let me alone
  with her.                                                       100

  _Fra._ Vat, vil you mak a her mad? seet, by min trat,
  be pretta servan; bush,[97] ick sall go to bet now.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Free._ Mischief, whither wilt thou? O thou tearless woman!
  How monstrous is thy devil,
  The end of hell as thee!
  How miserable were it to be virtuous,
  If thou couldst prosper!
  I'll to my love, the faithful Beatrice;
  She has wept enough, and faith, dear soul, too much.
  But yet how sweet is it to think how dear                       110
  One's life was to his love: how mourn'd his death!
  'Tis joy not to be express'd with breath:
  But O let him that would such passion drink,
  Be quiet of his speech, and only think!

                                                             [_Exit._

                       BEATRICE'S _chamber_.

                _Enter_ BEATRICE _and_ CRISPINELLA.


  _Bea._ Sister, cannot a woman kill herself? is it not
  lawful to die when we should not live?

  _Cri._ O sister, 'tis a question not for us; we must do
  what God will.

  _Bea._ What God will? Alas, can torment be His
  glory, or our grief His pleasure! Does not the nurse's
  nipple, juiced over with wormwood, bid the child it
  should not suck? And does not Heaven, when it hath
  made our breath bitter unto us, say we should not live?
  O my best sister,                                                10
  To suffer wounds when one may 'scape this rod
  Is against nature, that is against God!

  _Cri._ Good sister,
  Do not make me weep; sure Freevill was not false.
  I'll gage my life that strumpet, out of craft
  And some close second end, hath maliced[98] him.

  _Bea._ O sister! if he were not false, whom have I lost?
  If he were, what grief to such unkindness!
  From head to foot I am all misery;
  Only in this, some justice I have found--                        20
  My grief is like my love, beyond all bound.

                           _Enter_ NURSE.

  _Nur._ My servant, Master Caqueteur, desires to visit
  you.

  _Cri._ For grief's sake keep him out; his discourse is
  like the long word _Honorificabilitudinitatibus_,[99] a great
  deal of sound and no sense: his company is like a
  parenthesis to a discourse,--you may admit it, or leave
  it out, it makes no matter.

                _Enter_ FREEVILL _in his disguise_.

  _Free._ By your leave, sweet creatures.

  _Cri._ Sir, all I can yet say of you is, you are uncivil.

  _Free._ You must deny it. By your sorrow's leave,                31
  I bring some music to make sweet your grief.

  _Bea._ Whate'er you please. O break my heart!
  Canst thou yet pant? O dost thou yet survive?
  Thou didst not love him if thou now canst live!

                       FREEVILL _sings_.[100]

                 _O Love, how strangely sweet
                    Are thy weak passions!
                  That love and joy should meet
                    In self-same fashions!
                  O who can tell                                   40
                    The cause why this should move?
                  But only this,--
                    No reason ask of Love!_

                                            [BEATRICE _swounds_.[101]

  _Cri._ Hold, peace!--the gentlest soul is sownd. O
  my best sister!

  _Free._ Ha, get you gone, close the doors! My Beatrice!

                                                [_Discovers himself._

  Cursed be my indiscreet trials! O my immeasurably
  loving--

  _Cri._ She stirs, give air, she breathes!

  _Bea._ Where am I? Ha! how have I slipp'd off life?
  Am I in heaven? O my lord, though not loving,                    51
  By our eternal being, yet give me leave
  To rest by thy dear[102] side! Am I not in heaven?

  _Free._ O eternally much loved,[103] recollect your spirits!

  _Bea._ Ha, you do speak! I do see you, I do live!
  I would not die now: let me not burst with wonder.

  _Free._ Call up your blood; I live to honour you
  As the admired glory of your sex.
  Nor ever hath my love been false to you;
  Only I presum'd to try your faith too much,                      60
  For which I most am grieved.

  _Cri._ Brother, I must be plain with you, you have
  wrong'd us.

  _Free._ I am not so covetous to deny it;
  But yet, when my discourse hath stay'd your quaking,
  You will be smoother lipp'd; and the delight
  And satisfaction which we all have got,
  Under these strange disguisings, when you know,
  You will be mild and quiet, forget at last:
  It is much joy to think on sorrows past.

  _Bea._ Do you then live? and are you not untrue?                 70
  Let me not die with joy; pleasure's more extreme
  Than grief; there's nothing sweet to man but mean.

  _Free._ Heaven cannot be too gracious to such goodness.
  I shall discourse to you the several chances;
  But hark, I must yet rest disguis'd;
  The sudden close of many drifts now meet:
  Where pleasure hath some profit, art is sweet.

                          _Enter_ TYSEFEW.

  _Tyse._ News, news, news, news!

  _Cri._ Oysters, oysters, oysters, oysters!                       79

  _Tyse._ Why, is not this well now? Is not this better
  than louring and pouting and puling, which is hateful to
  the living and vain to the dead? Come, come, you must
  live by the quick, when all is done; and for my own part,
  let my wife laugh at me when I am dead, so she'll smile
  upon me whilst I live: but to see a woman whine, and
  yet keep her eyes dry: mourn, and yet keep her cheeks
  fat: nay, to see a woman claw her husband by the feet
  when he is dead, that would have scratched him by
  the face when he was living--this now is somewhat
  ridiculous.                                                      90

  _Cri._ Lord, how you prate.

  _Tyse._ And yet I was afraid, i'faith, that I should ha'
  seen a garland on this beauty's hearse; but time, truth,
  experience, and variety, are great doers with women.

  _Cri._ But what's the news?--the news, I pray you?

  _Tyse._ I pray you? ne'er pray me: for by your leave
  you may command me. This 'tis:
  The public sessions, which this day is past,
  Hath doom'd to death ill-fortuned Malheureux.

  _Cri._ But, sir, we heard he offer'd to make good,              100
  That Freevill lived at Shatewe's the jeweller's----

  _Bea._ And that 'twas but a plot betwixt them two.

  _Tyse._ O, ay, ay, he gaged his life with it; but know,
  When all approach'd the test, Shatewe[104] denied
  He saw or heard of any such complot,
  Or of Freevill; so that his own defence
  Appeared so false, that, like a madman's sword,
  He stroke his own heart; he hath the course of law,
  And instantly must suffer. But the jest
  (If hanging be a jest, as many make it)                         110
  Is to take notice of one Mulligrub,
  A sharking vintner.

  _Free._ What of him, sir?

  _Tyse._ Nothing but hanging: the whoreson slave is mad
  before he hath lost his senses.

  _Free._ Was his fact[105] clear and made apparent, sir?

  _Tyse._ No, faith, suspicious; for 'twas thus protested:
  A cloak was stol'n; that cloak he had; he had it,
  Himself confess'd, by force; the rest of his defence
  The choler of a justice wronged in wine,                        120
  Join'd with malignance of some hasty jurors,
  Whose wit was lighted by the justice' nose;
  The knave was cast.
  But, Lord, to hear his moan, his prayers, his wishes,
  His zeal ill-timèd, and his words unpitied,
  Would make a dead man rise and smile,
  Whilst he observed how fear can make men vile.

  _Cri._ Shall we go meet the execution?

  _Bea._ I shall be ruled by you.

  _Tyse._ By my troth, a rare motion;[106] you must haste,
  For malefactors goes like the world, upon wheels.               130

  _Bea._ Will you man us? You shall be our guide.

                                                 [_To_[107] FREEVILL.

  _Free._ I am your servant.

  _Tyse._ Ha, servant? Zounds, I am no companion for
  panders! you're best make him your love.

  _Bea._ So will I, sir; we must live by the quick, you say.

  _Tyse._ 'Sdeath o' virtue! what a damn'd thing's this!
  Who'll trust fair faces, tears, and vows? 'Sdeath! not I.
  She is a woman,--that is,--she can lie.

  _Cri._ Come, come, turn not a man of time,[108] to make all ill
  Whose goodness you conceive not, since the worst of chance      140
  Is to crave grace for heedless ignorance.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                         _A Public Place._

               _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY, _like a sergeant_.


  _Coc._ So, I ha' lost my sergeant in an ecliptic mist,
  drunk! horrible drunk! he is fine. So now will I fit
  myself; I hope this habit will do me no harm; I am an
  honest man already. Fit, fit, fit, as a punk's tail, that
  serves everybody. By this time my vintner thinks of
  nothing but hell and sulphur; he farts fire and brimstone
  already. Hang toasts! the execution approacheth.

  _Enter_ Sir LIONEL, Sir HUBERT; MALHEUREUX, _pinioned_;
     TYSEFEW, BEATRICE, FREEVILL, CRISPINELLA, FRANCESCHINA,
     _and halberds_.

  _Mal._ I do not blush, although condemned by laws;
  No kind of death is shameful but the cause,
  Which I do know is none; and yet my lust                         10
  Hath made the one (although not cause) most just.
  May I not be reprieved? Freevill is but mislodg'd;
  Some lethargy hath seiz'd him--no, much malice;
  Do not lay blood upon your souls with good intents;
  Men may do ill, and law sometime repents.

                              [COCLEDEMOY _picks_ MALHEUREUX' _pocket
                                 of his purse_.

  _Sir Lio._ Sir, sir, prepare; vain is all lewd defence.

  _Mal._ Conscience was law, but now law's conscience.
  My endless peace is made; and to the poor,--
  My purse, my purse!

  _Coc._ Ay, sir; and it shall please you, the poor has
  your purse already.                                              21

  _Mal._ You[109] are a wily[110] man.
  --But now, thou source of devils, oh, how I loathe
  The very memory of that I adored!
  He that's of fair blood, well mien'd, of good breeding,
  Best famed, of sweet acquaintance, and true friends,
  And would with desperate impudence lose all these,
  And hazard landing at this fatal shore,--
  Let him ne'er kill, nor steal, but love a whore.

  _Fra._ De man does rave; tinck a got, tinck a got, and
  bid de flesh, de world, and the dible, farewell.                 31

  _Mal._ Farewell!

  _Free._ Farewell!

                                       [FREEVILL _discovers himself_.

  _Fra._ Vat ist you see?--Hah!

  _Free._ Sir, your pardon, with my this defence:
  Do not forget protested violence
  Of your low affections: no requests,
  No arguments of reason, no known danger,
  No assured wicked bloodiness,
  Could draw your heart from this damnation.                       40

  _Mal._ Why, stay!

  _Fra._ Unprosperous devil, vat sall me do now?

  _Free._ Therefore, to force you from the truer danger,
  I wrought the feignèd; suffering this fair devil
  In shape of woman to make good her plot:
  And, knowing that the hook was deeply fast,
  I gave her line at will, till, with her own vain strivings,
  See here she's tired. O thou comely damnation!
  Dost think that vice is not to be withstood?
  O what is woman, merely made of blood!                           50

  _Sir Lio._ You maze us all; let us not be lost in darkness!

  _Free._ All shall be lighted; but this time and place
  Forbids longer speech; only what you can think
  Has been extremely ill, is only hers.

  _Sir Lio._ To severest prison with her! With what heart canst live--
  What eyes behold a face?

  _Fra._ Ick vil not speak; torture, torture your fill,
  For me am worse than hang'd; me ha' lost my will.

                               [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA _with the guard_.

  _Sir Lio._ To the extremest whip and jail.

  _Free._ Frolic, how is it, sirs?                                 60

  _Mal._ I am myself. How long was't ere I could
  Persuade my passion to grow calm to you!
  Rich sense makes good bad language, and a friend
  Should weigh no action, but the action's end.
  I am now worthy yours; when before
  The beast of man, loose blood, distemper'd us:
  He that lust rules cannot be virtuous.

       _Enter_ MULLIGRUB, Mistress MULLIGRUB, _and Officers_.

  _Off._ On afore there! room for the prisoners!

  _Mul._ I pray you do not lead me to execution through
  Cheapside. I owe Master Burnish, the goldsmith,
  money, and I fear he'll set a sergeant on my back for it.

  _Coc._ Trouble not your sconce, my Christian brothers,
  but have an eye unto the main chance. I will warrant
  your shoulders; as for your neck, _Plinius Secundus_, or
  _Marcus Tullius Cicero_, or somebody it is, says that a
  threefold cord is hardly broken.                                 75

  _Mul._ Well, I am not the first honest man that hath
  been cast away; and I hope shall not be the last.

  _Coc._ O, sir, have a good stomach and maws; you shall
  have a joyful supper.

  _Mul._ In troth I have no stomach to it; and it please
  you, take my trencher; I use to fast at nights.                  81

  _Mistress Mul._ O husband! I little thought you should
  have come to think on God thus soon;[111] nay, and you
  had been hang'd deservedly it would never have grieved
  me; I have known of many honest innocent men have
  been hang'd deservedly: but to be cast away for nothing!

  _Coc._ Good woman, hold your peace, your prittles and
  your prattles, your bibbles and your babbles; for I pray
  you hear me in private: I am a widower, and you are
  almost a widow; shall I be welcome to your houses, to
  your tables, and your other things?                              92

  _Mistress Mul._ I have a piece of mutton and a featherbed
  for you at all times; I pray make haste.

  _Mul._ I do here make my confession: if I owe any
  man anything, I do heartily forgive him; if any man
  owe me anything, let him pay my wife.

  _Coc._ I will look to your wife's payment, I warrant
  you.

  _Mul._ And now, good yoke-fellow, leave thy poor
  Mulligrub.                                                      101

  _Mistress Mul._ Nay, then I were unkind; i'faith I will
  not leave you until I have seen you hang.

  _Coc._ But brother,[112] brother, you must think of your
  sins and iniquities; you have been a broacher of profane
  vessels; you have made us drink of the juice of the whore
  of Babylon: for whereas good ale, perrys, bragots,[113]
  cyders, and metheglins, was the true ancient British and
  Troyan drinks, you ha' brought in Popish wines, Spanish
  wines, French wines, _tam Marti quam Mercurio_, both muscadine
  and malmsey, to the subversion, staggering, and
  sometimes overthrow of many a good Christian. You
  ha' been a great jumbler; O remember the sins of your
  nights! for your night works ha' been unsavoury in the
  taste of your customers.                                        115

  _Mul._ I confess, I confess; and I forgive as I would
  be forgiven. Do you know one Cocledemoy?

  _Coc._ O very well. Know him!--an honest man he is,
  and a comely; an upright dealer with his neighbours,
  and their wives speak good things of him.                       120

  _Mul._ Well, wheresoe'er he is, or whatsoe'er he is, I'll
  take it on my death he's the cause of my hanging. I
  heartily forgive him, and if he would come forth he
  might save me; for he only knows the why and the
  wherefore.

  _Coc._ You do, from your hearts and midrifs and entrails,
  forgive him then? you will not let him rot in rusty irons,
  procure him to be hang'd in lousy linen without a song,
  and after he is dead piss on his grave?

  _Mul._ That hard heart of mine has procured all this;
  but I forgive as I would be forgiven.                           131

  _Coc._ [_Discovering himself_] Hang toasts, my worshipful
  Mulligrub. Behold thy Cocledemoy, my fine vintner;
  my castrophomical fine boy; behold and see!

  _Tyse._ Bliss o' the blessed, who would but look for
  two knaves here?

  _Coc._ No knave, worshipful friend, no knave; for observe,
  honest Cocledemoy restores whatsoever he has
  got, to make you know that whatsoever he has done,
  has been only _euphoniæ gratia_--for wit's sake. I
  acquit this vintner, as he has acquitted me; all has
  been done for emphasis of wit, my fine boy, my worshipful
  friends.

  _Tyse._ Go, you are a flatt'ring knave.                         143

  _Coc._ I am so; 'tis a good thriving trade; it comes
  forward better than the seven liberal sciences, or the
  nine cardinal virtues; which may well appear in this,
  you shall never have flattering knave turn courtier.
  And yet I have read of many courtiers that have turned
  flattering knaves.

  _Sir Hub._ Was't even but so? why, then all's well.             150

  _Mul._ I could even weep for joy.

  _Mistress Mul._ I could weep too, but God knows for
  what!

  _Tyse._ Here's another tack to be given--your son and
  daughter.

  _Sir Hub._ Is't possible? heart, ay, all my heart; will
  you be joined here?

  _Tyse._ Yes, faith, father; marriage and hanging are
  spun both in one hour.

  _Coc._ Why, then, my worshipful good friends, I bid
  myself most heartily welcome to your merry nuptials
  and wanton jigga-joggies.--And now, my very fine
  Heliconian gallants, and you, my worshipful friends in
  the middle region,                                              164
  If with content our hurtless mirth hath been,
  Let your pleased minds at our much care be seen;[114]
