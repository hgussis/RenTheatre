Printed forThomas Fisher, and are to be soulde in Saint Dunstans Church-yarde._1602. 4to.                        STORY OF THE PLAY.Piero had been a suitor for the hand of Maria, daughter of the Duke ofFerrara, but his addresses had been rejected and Maria had marriedAndrugio, the offspring of the union being Antonio. When Piero,dissembling his hatred, affects to be reconciled to Andrugio, Lucio isdespatched to bring Maria to the Venetian Court. Piero, at a banquetgiven on the eve of his daughter's marriage with Antonio, instils inAndrugio's cup a poison which has no immediate effect but worksfatally after a few hours. With the help of a base creature, Strotzo,he proceeds in the night to murder Antonio's friend, Feliche, whosebody is carried by Strotzo to Mellida's chamber. At sunrise Maria andLucio arrive at Venice. Antonio, whose sleep has been troubled byhideous dreams, is abroad early, and is met by his mother as he pacesdisquietly in front of Mellida's chamber. Presently the window-curtainis drawn aside and there is exposed the body of Feliche, stabbed thickwith wounds. While Antonio is distractedly calling upon Mellida torise, Piero advances and proclaims himself the author of Feliche'sdeath, protesting that he had found his daughter in the embraces ofthe murdered man. The scene of confusion is heightened by the entranceof Strotzo, who announces that Andrugio has died from excess of joy athis sudden change of fortunes. Mellida is put in close confinement,and a day is appointed for her trial. Strotzo is instructed by Pieroto come forward at the trial and accuse Antonio of having instigatedthe murders of Andrugio and Feliche. But before the trial Andrugio'sghost appears to Antonio, discloses Piero's villainy, and bids Antoniotake vengeance on the murderer. Antonio stabs Piero's young son Julioat Andrugio's shrine; he then disguises himself as Maria's fool andwatches his opportunity for further vengeance. The trial of Mellida isheld: Strotzo enters the court with a cord round his neck, declaringthat he had been suborned by Antonio to commit the crimes; andofficers are despatched to arrest Antonio, who in his fool's habit iswatching the proceedings. It had been part of the plot that Strotzo,after making his confession, should break into passionate outbursts ofsorrow and implore Piero to rid him of a dishonourable life; whereuponPiero was to spring forward, grasp the cord round Strotzo's neck aswith intent to strangle him, then suddenly to relax his hold, moved byStrotzo's penitent conduct. Strotzo goes through his part of theperformance; but Piero, grasping one end of the cord while Castilio (acourtier) grasps the other, is careful not to loose his hold beforethe victim is strangled. Presently word is brought that Antonio in afit of distraction has flung himself from a high tower into the sea.At this news Mellida falls into a deep swoon and is conveyed to herchamber, whither Antonio after a short delay contrives to follow her,but arrives only in time to see her expire. Piero, notwithstanding hisdaughter's untoward death, determines that his marriage with Maria(who affects to acquiesce in the arrangement) shall take place withoutdelay. A scheme of vengeance is contrived between Antonio, Pandulfo(Feliche's father) and Alberto (Feliche's friend). The conspiratorsattire themselves as maskers and appear at a banquet given by Piero onthe eve of his marriage. On the appearance of the maskers Pieroenquires for his son, Julio, and sends an attendant to fetch him tosee the dances. After dancing a measure the maskers request Piero tohave the hall cleared while they sit unmasked at the banquet.Thereupon the guests and retainers withdraw, but Piero at the maskers'request remains. He takes a seat at the banquet; the conspirators,unmasking themselves, spring forward and bind him with cords to thechair; insult over him, cut out his tongue, produce in a dish thelimbs of his murdered son, and finally hack him to death with theirswords. The tyrant's death is welcomed with universal joy. Theconspirators are hailed as saviours of their country, and are offeredhigh offices of state; but prefer to spend the rest of their lives inthe seclusion of a religious house.                           THE PROLOGUE.  The rawish dank of clumsy[193] winter ramps  The fluent summer's vein; and drizzling sleet  Chilleth the wan bleak cheek of the numb'd earth,  Whilst snarling gusts nibble the juiceless leaves  From the nak'd shudd'ring branch; and pills[194] the skin  From off the soft and delicate aspects.  O now, methinks, a sullen tragic scene  Would suit the time with pleasing congruence.  May we be happy in our weak devoir,  And all part pleasèd in most wish'd content!                     10  But sweat of Hercules can ne'er beget  So blest an issue. Therefore, we proclaim,  If any spirit breathes within this round,  Uncapable of weighty passion,  (As from his birth being huggèd in the arms,  And nuzzled 'twixt the breasts of happiness)  Who winks, and shuts his apprehension up  From common sense of what men were and are,  Who would not know what men must be--let such  Hurry amain from our black-visaged shows:                        20  We shall affright their eyes. But if a breast  Nail'd to the earth with grief; if any heart  Pierc'd through with anguish pant within this ring;  If there be any blood whose heat is choked  And stifled with true sense of misery;  If ought of these strains fill this consort up--  Th' arrive most welcome. O that our power  Could lackey or keep wing with our desires,  That with unusèd paize[195] of style and sense,  We might weigh massy in judicious scale.      30  Yet here's the prop that doth support our hopes:  When our scenes falter, or invention halts,  Your favour will give crutches to our faults.[196]         [_Exit._     [193] Marston's use of the words _clumsy_ and _ramp_ is     ridiculed in _The Poetaster_ (v. 1).     [194] Peels.     [195] An old form of _poise_.     [196] "This prologue, for its passionate earnestness, and for the     tragic note of preparation which it sounds, might have preceded     one of those tales of Thebes, or Pelops' line, which Milton has     so highly commended, as free from the common errors in his days,     'of intermixing comic stuff with tragic sadness and gravity,     brought in without discretion corruptly to gratify the people.'     It is as solemn a preparative as the 'warning voice which he who     saw th' Apocalypse heard cry.'"--_Charles Lamb._                      _DRAMATIS PERSONÆ._[197]  PIERO SFORZA, _Duke of Venice_.  ANTONIO, _son to the murdered_ ANDRUGIO, _affianced to_ MELLIDA.  PANDULFO, _father to the murdered_ FELICHE.  ALBERTO, _a Venetian gentleman_.  BALURDO, _a rich gull_.  MATZAGENTE, _a modern braggadoch_.  GALEATZO, _son to the Duke of Milan_.  FOROBOSCO, _a Parasite_.  CASTILIO BALTHAZAR, _a spruce courtier_.  LUCIO, _an old nobleman, attendant to_ MARIA.  STROTZO, _a creature of_ PIERO.  JULIO, _son to_ PIERO.  MARIA, ANDRUGIO'S _widow, mother to_ ANTONIO.  MELLIDA, _daughter to_ PIERO, _affianced to_ ANTONIO.  NUTRICHE, _attendant to_ MARIA.  _Two Senators, Herald, Waiting-women, Page, &c._  _Ghost of_ ANDRUGIO, _Ghost of_ FELICHE.                         THE SCENE--VENICE.     [197] There is no list of characters in the old eds.                        ANTONIO'S REVENGE.                              ACT I.                             SCENE I.               _A corridor in the palace of_ PIERO.     _Enter_ PIERO, _unbraced, his arms bare, smeared in blood,      a poniard in one hand bloody, and a torch in the other_;                STROTZO _following him with a cord_.  _Pier._ Ho, Gasper Strotzo, bind Feliche's trunk  Unto the panting side of Mellida!                                                     [_Exit_ STROTZO.  'Tis yet dead night, yet all the earth is clutch'd[198]  In the dull leaden hand of snoring sleep;  No breath disturbs the quiet of the air,  No spirit moves upon the breast of earth,  Save howling dogs, night-crows, and screeching owls,  Save meagre ghosts, Piero, and black thoughts.  One, two!                                                    [_Clock strikes._  Lord, in two hours what a topless mount                          10  Of unpeer'd mischief have these hands cast up!                        _Re-enter_ STROTZO.  I can scarce coop triumphing vengeance up  From bursting forth in braggart passion.  _Str._ My lord, 'tis firmly said that----  _Pier._ Andrugio sleeps in peace: this brain hath choked  The organ of his breast.

You horrid scouts  That sentinel swart night, give loud applause                    20  From your large palms. First, know, my heart was rais'd  Unto Andrugio's life upon this ground--  _Str._ Duke, 'tis reported----  _Pier._ We both were rivals in our may of blood,  Unto Maria, fair Ferrara's heir.  He won the lady, to my honour's death,  And from her sweets cropp'd this Antonio;  For which I burnt in inward swelt'ring hate,  And fester'd rankling malice in my breast,  Till I might belk revenge upon his eyes:                         30  And now (O blessèd now!) 'tis done. Hell, night,  Give loud applause to my hypocrisy.  When his bright valour even dazzled sense,  In off'ring his own head, public reproach  Had blurr'd my name. Speak, Strotzo, had it not?  If then I had----  _Str._ It had, so please----  _Pier._ What had, so please? Unseasoned sycophant,  Piero Sforza is no numbèd lord,  Senseless of all true touch;[199] stroke not the head            40  Of infant speech, till it be fully born;  Go to!  _Str._ How now! Fut, I'll not smother your speech.  _Pier._ Nay, right thine eyes: 'twas but a little spleen,--  (Huge plunge![200]  Sin's grown a slave, and must observe slight evils;  Huge villains are enforced to claw[201] all devils.)--  Pish, sweet, thy thoughts, and give me----.  _Str._ Stroke not the head of infant speech! go to!  _Pier._ Nay, calm this storm. I ever held thy breast  More secret, and more firm in league of blood,                   50  Than to be struck in heat with each slight puff.  Give me thy ears; huge infamy [had] press['d] down  My honour, if even then, when his fresh act  Of prowess bloom'd out full,  I had ta'en vengeance on his hated head----.  _Str._ Why it had----.  _Pier._ Could I avoid to give a seeming grant  Unto fruition of Antonio's love?  _Str._ No.  _Pier._ And didst thou ever see a Judas kiss                     60  With a more covert touch of fleering hate?  _Str._ No.  _Pier._ And having clipt them with pretence of love,  Have I not crush'd them with a cruel wring?  _Str._ Yes.  _Pier._ Say, faith, didst thou e'er hear, or read, or see  Such happy vengeance, unsuspected death?  That I should drop strong poison in the bowl,  Which I myself caroused unto his health  And future fortune of our unity!                                 70  That it should work even in the hush[202] of night,  And strangle him on sudden, that fair show  Of death, for the excessive joy of his fate,  Might choke the murder! Ha, Strotzo, is't not rare?  Nay, but weigh it. Then Feliche stabb'd  (Whose sinking thought[203] frighted my conscious heart),  And laid by Mellida, to stop the match,  And hale on mischief. This all in one night!  Is't to be equall'd, think'st thou? O, I could eat  Thy fumbling throat, for thy lagg'd censure. Fut,                80  Is't not rare?  _Str._ Yes.  _Pier._ No? yes? nothing but _no_ and _yes_, dull lump?  Canst thou not honey me with fluent speech,  And even adore my topless villainy?  Will I not blast my own blood for revenge,  Must not thou straight be perjur'd for revenge,  And yet no creature dream 'tis my revenge?  Will I not turn a glorious bridal morn  Unto a Stygian night? Yet naught but _no_ and _yes_!             90  _Str._ I would have told you, if the incubus[204]  That rides your bosom would have patience,  It is reported that in private state  Maria, Genoa's duchess, makes to court,  Longing to see him, whom she ne'er shall see,  Her lord Andrugio. Belike she hath receiv'd  The news of reconciliation.  A[205] reconciliation with death!  Poor lady! shall but find poor comfort in't.  _Pier._ O, let me swoon for joy. By heaven, I think             100  I ha' said my prayers, within this month at least;  I am so boundless happy. Doth she come?  By this warm reeking gore, I'll marry her.  Look I not now like an inamorate?[206]  Poison the father, butcher the son, and marry the mother, ha!  Strotzo, to bed: snort in securest sleep;  For see, the dapple grey coursers of the morn  Beat up the light with their bright silver hooves,  And chase it through the sky.--To bed, to bed!  This morn my vengeance shall be amply fed.

O God! I was even  coming to it, law. O Jesu! 'twas coming of the sweetest.  I'll tell you now, methought I was married, and methought  I spent (O Lord, why did you wake me?), and  methought I spent three spur-royals[209] on the fiddlers for  striking up a fresh hornpipe. Saint Ursula! I was even  going to bed, and you, methought, my husband, was  even putting out the tapers, when you--Lord I shall never  have such a dream come upon me, as long as----.                  40  _Mar._ Peace, idle creature, peace!--When will the  court rise?  _Lu._ Madam, 'twere best you took some lodging up,  And lay in private till the soil of grief  Were clear'd your cheek, and new burnish'd lustre  Clothèd your presence, 'fore you saw the dukes,  And enter'd 'mong the proud Venetian states.[210]  _Mar._ No, Lucio, my dear lord is wise, and knows  That tinsel glitter, or rich purfled[211] robes,  Curl'd hairs, hung full of sparkling carcanets,  Are not the true adornments of a wife.                           50  So long as wives are faithful, modest, chaste,  Wise lords affect them. Virtue doth not waste  With each slight flame of crackling vanity.  A modest eye forceth affection,  Whilst outward gayness' light looks but entice:  Fairer than nature's fair is foulest vice.  She that loves art to get her cheek more lovers,  Much outward gauds, slight inward grace discovers.  I care not to seem fair but to my lord:  Those that strive most to please most strangers' sight,  Folly may judge most fair, wisdom most light.                    61                                      [_Music sounds a short strain._  But hark, soft music gently moves the air!  I think the bridegroom's up.

Truth  is the touchstone of all things; and, if your nose will not  abide the truth, your nose will not abide the touch; and,  if your nose will not abide the touch, your nose is a  copper nose, and must be nail'd up for a slip.[216]  _Mat._ I scorn to retort the obtuse jest of a fool.                 [BALURDO _draws out his writing tables, and writes_.  _Bal._ Retort and obtuse, good words, very good words.  _Gal._ Young prince, look sprightly; fie, a bridegroom sad!  _Bal._ In truth, if he were retort and obtuse, no question  he would be merry; but, and please my genius, I will be  most retort and obtuse ere night.

As I  am a true knight, will't not be most retort and obtuse,  ha?                                                             101  _Ant._ Blow hence these sapless jests. I tell you, bloods,  My spirit's heavy, and the juice of life  Creeps slowly through my stiffen'd arteries.  Last sleep, my sense was steep'd in horrid dreams:  Three parts of night were swallow'd in the gulf  Of ravenous time, when to my slumb'ring powers,  Two meagre ghosts made apparition.  The one's breast seem'd fresh paunch'd with bleeding wounds,  Whose bubbling gore sprang in [my] frighted eyes;               110  The other ghost assum'd my father's shape:  Both cried, "Revenge!" At which my trembling joints,  Icèd quite over with a frozed cold sweat,[217]  Leap'd forth the sheets. Three[218] times I g[r]asp'd at shades,  And thrice, deluded by erroneous sense,  I forc'd my thoughts make stand; when lo, I oped[219]  A large bay window, th[o]rough which the night  Struck terror to my soul. The verge of heaven  Was ring'd with flames, and all the upper vault  Thick-lac'd with flakes of fire; in midst whereof               120  A blazing comet shot his threat'ning train  Just on my face. Viewing these prodigies,  I bow'd my naked knee and pierc'd the star  With an outfacing eye, pronouncing thus:  _Deus imperat astris_. At which, my nose straight bled;  Then doubted I my word, so slunk to bed.                        126  _Bal._ Verily, Sir Jeffrey had a monstrous strange dream  the last night. For methought I dreamt I was asleep,  and methought the ground yawn'd and belkt up the  abhominable ghost of a misshapen simile, with two ugly  pages; the one called master, even as going before; and  the other mounser,[220] even so following after; whilst  Signior Simile stalk'd most prodigiously in the midst.  At which I bewray'd[221] the fearfulness of my nature, and  being ready to forsake the fortress of my wit, start up,  called for a clean shirt, ate a mess of broth, and with  that I awaked.  _Ant._ I prithee, peace. I tell you, gentlemen,  The frightful shades of night yet shake my brain:  My jellied[222] blood's not thaw'd: the sulphur damps,          140  That flew[223] in wingèd lightning 'bout my couch,  Yet stick within my sense, my soul is great  In expectation of dire prodigies.  _Pan._ Tut, my young prince, let not thy fortunes see  Their lord a coward. He that's nobly born  Abhors to fear: base fear's the brand of slaves.  He that observes, pursues, slinks back for fright,  Was never cast in mould of noble sprite.  _Gal._ Tush, there's a sun will straight exhale these damps  Of chilling fear.

Pish!  Thou canst not coop me up. Hadst thou a jail  With treble walls, like antique Babylon,  Pandulpho can get out. I tell thee, duke,  I have old Fortunatus' wishing-cap,  And can be where I list even in a trice.  I'll skip from earth into the arms of heaven:  And from triumphal arch of blessedness,                         150  Spit on thy frothy breast. Thou canst not slave  Or banish me; I will be free at home,  Maugre the beard of greatness. The port-holes  Of sheathèd spirit are ne'er corbèd[246] up,  But still stand open ready to discharge  Their precious shot into the shrouds of heaven.  _Pier._ O torture! slave, I banish thee the town,  Thy native seat of birth.  _Pan._ How proud thou speak'st! I tell thee, duke, the blasts   159  Of the swoll'n-cheek'd winds, nor all the breath of kings  Can puff me out my native seat of birth.  The earth's my body's, and the heaven's my soul's  Most native place of birth, which they will keep  Despite the menace of mortality.  Why, duke,  That's not my native place,[247] where I was rock'd.  A wise man's home is wheresoe'er he is wise;  Now that, from man, not from the place, doth rise.  _Pier._ Would I were deaf!

Seneca     wrote a dissertation to show "Nec injuriam nec contumeliam     accipere sapientem."     [243] "I do fear a _fetch_," _i.e._, I suspect that     Andrugio has perished by treachery. _Fetch_ = plot, device.     [244] There is an Attic flavour in this passage of     _stichomythia_. For a passing moment one is reminded of     Creon's altercation with his son (in the _Antigone_):--          Kr. ô pankakiste, dia dikês iôn patri.          Hai. ou gar dikaia s' examartanonth horô.          Kr. hamartanô gar tas emas archas sebôn?          Hai. ou gar sebeis, timas ge tas theôn patôn.     [245] Marston uses indifferently the forms _chawn_ and _jawn_ for     a rift or chasm.     [246] "Corbèd" (old eds. "corb'd") is "good," as Polonius would     say; but I have no suspicion as to its meaning. It would be a     pity to suggest an emendation.     [247] Seneca is fond of harping on this theme. "In ultimas     expellaris terras licebit," he writes in one of his epistles, "in     quolibet barbariæ angulo colloceris, hospitalis tibi illa     qualiscumque sedes erit; magis quis veneris quam quo, interest,     et ideo nulli loco addicere debemus arbitrium. Cum hac     persuasione vivendum est: 'Non sum uni angulo natus, patria mea     totus hic mundus est.'"                             SCENE II.                   _Before the palace of_ PIERO.   _Enter_ ANTONIO, _in black, with a book_; LUCIO _and_ ALBERTO.  _Alb._ Nay, sweet, be comforted, take counsel and----.  _Ant._ Alberto, peace: that grief is wanton-sick,  Whose stomach can digest and brook the diet  Of stale ill-relish'd counsel.

I tell thee, Lucio,  Sooner will I give faith that Virtue's cant[249]  In princes' courts will be adorn'd with wreath  Of choice respect, and endear'd intimate;  Sooner will I believe that friendship's rein  Will curb ambition from utility,                                 30  Than Mellida is light. Alas, poor soul,  Didst e'er see her?--good heart!--hast heard her speak?  Kind, kind soul!

O, now triumphs my ghost,  Exclaiming, Heaven's just, for I shall see  The scourge of murder and impiety!                                                             [_Exit._     [314] This line is ridiculed in _The Poetaster_, v. 1:--                        "Break his back,           O poets all and some! for now we list          _Of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist_."                             SCENE I.                  BALURDO _from under the Stage_.  _Bal._ Ho, who's above there, ho? A murrain on all  proverbs. They say hunger breaks through stone walls;  but I am as gaunt as lean-ribb'd famine, yet I can burst  through no stone walls. O now, Sir Jeffrey, show thy  valour, break prison and be hang'd. Nor shall the  darkest nook of hell contain the discontented Sir  Balurdo's ghost. Well, I am out well; I have put  off the prison to put on the rope. O poor shotten  herring, what a pickle art thou in! O hunger, how thou  domineer'st in my guts! O for a fat leg of ewe mutton  in stewed broth, or drunken song to feed on! I could  belch rarely, for I am all wind. O cold, cold, cold,  cold, cold! O poor knight! O poor Sir Jeffrey, sing  like an unicorn before thou dost dip thy horn in the  water of death. O cold, O sing, O cold, O poor  Sir Jeffrey, sing, sing!                                         16                                                           [_A song._        _Enter_ ANTONIO _and_ Alberto _at several doors, their               rapiers drawn, in their masking attire_.  _Ant._ Vindicta!  _Alb._ Mellida!  _Ant._ Alberto!  _Alb._ Antonio!  _Ant._ Hath the Duke supp'd?  _Alb._ Yes, and triumphant revels mount aloft.  The Duke drinks deep to overflow his grief;  The court is rack'd to pleasure; each man strains  To feign a jocund eye. The Florentine----  _Ant._ Young Galeatzo!  _Alb._ Even he is mighty on our part. The states of Venice----         _Enter_ PANDULPHO, _running, in masking attire_.  _Pan._ Like high-swoll'n floods drive down the muddy dams  Of pent allegiance. O, my lusty bloods,  Heaven sits clapping of our enterprise.                          30  I have been labouring general favour firm,  And I do find the citizens grown sick  With swallowing the bloody crudities  Of black Piero's acts; they fain would cast  And vomit him from off their government.  Now is the plot of mischief ript wide ope;  Letters are found 'twixt Strotzo and the Duke,  So clear apparent, yet more firmly strong  By suiting circumstance, that, as I walk'd,  Muffled, to eavesdrop speech, I might observe                    40  The graver statesmen whispering fearfully.  Here one gives nods and hums what he would speak;  The rumour's got 'mong troop of citizens,  Making loud murmur, with confusèd din;  One shakes his head and sighs, "O ill-used power!"  Another frets, and sets his grinding teeth,  Foaming with rage, and swears this must not be;  Here one complots, and on a sudden starts,  And cries, O monstrous, O deep villainy!  All knit their nerves, and from beneath swoll'n brows            50  Appears a gloating eye of much mislike;  Whilst swart Piero's lips reak steam of wine,  Swallows lust-thoughts, devours all pleasing hopes,  With strong imagination of--what not?  O now Vindicta! that's the word we have,  A royal vengeance, or a royal grave!  _Ant._ Vindicta!  _Bal._ [_From beneath the stage._] I am acold.  _Pan._ Who's there? Sir Jeffrey?  _Bal._ A poor knight, god wot: the nose of thy knighthood  is bitten off with cold. O poor Sir Jeffrey, cold,  cold!                                                            62  _Pan._ What chance of fortune hath tripp'd up his heels,  And laid him in the kennel, ha?  _Alb._ I will discourse it all. Poor honest soul,  Hadst thou a beaver to clasp up thy face,  Thou should'st associate us in masquery,  And see revenge.  _Bal._ Nay, and you talk of revenge, my stomach's up,  for I am most tyrannically hungry. A beaver! I have  a headpiece, a skull, a brain of proof, I warrant ye.            71  _Alb._ Slink to my chamber then, and tire thee.  _Bal._ Is there a fire?  _Alb._ Yes.  _Bal._ Is there a fat leg of ewe mutton?  _Alb._ Yes.  _Bal._ And a clean shirt?  _Alb._ Yes.  _Bal._ Then am I for you, most pathetically, and unvulgarly,  law!                                                             80                                                             [_Exit._  _Ant._ Resolved hearts, time curtails night, opportunity  shakes us his foretop.

Dost love me, fairest? Say.  _Mar._ As I do hate my son, I love thy soul.  _Pier._ Why, then, Io[315] to Hymen, mount a lofty note!  Fill[316] red-cheek'd Bacchus, let Lyæus float                   20  In burnish'd goblets!
