  _Enter_ GALEATZO, PIERO, ALBERTO, ANTONIO, FOROBOSCO, BALURDO,
    MATZAGENTE, _and_ FELICHE, _with parts in their hands; having
    cloaks cast over their apparel_.


  _Gal._ Come, sirs, come! the music will sound straight for entrance.
  Are ye ready, are ye perfect?

  _Pier._ Faith! we can say our parts; but we are ignorant in what
  mould we must cast our actors.

  _Alb._ Whom do you personate?

  _Pier._ Piero, Duke of Venice.

  _Alb._ O! ho! then thus frame your exterior shape
  To haughty form of elate majesty,
  As if you held the palsy-shaking head
  Of reeling chance under your fortune's belt                      10
  In strictest vassalage: grow big in thought,
  As swoln with glory of successful arms.

  _Pier._ If that be all, fear not; I'll suit it right.
  Who cannot be proud, stroke up the hair, and strut?

  _Alb._ Truth; such rank custom is grown popular;
  And now the vulgar fashion strides as wide,
  And stalks as proud upon the weakest stilts
  Of the slight'st fortunes, as if Hercules
  Or burly Atlas shoulder'd up their state.

  _Pier._ Good: but whom act you?                                  20

  _Alb._ The necessity[36] of the play forceth me to act two
  parts: Andrugio, the distressed Duke of Genoa, and
  Alberto, a Venetian gentleman, enamoured on the Lady
  Rossaline; whose fortunes being too weak to sustain
  the port of her, he proved always disastrous in love; his
  worth being much underpoised by the uneven scale, that
  currents all things by the outward stamp of opinion.

  _Gal._ Well, and what dost thou play?

  _Bal._ The part of all the world.

  _Alb._ The part of all the world? What's that?                   30

  _Bal._ The fool. Ay, in good deed law now, I play
  Balurdo, a wealthy mountbanking burgomasco's heir of
  Venice.

  _Alb._ Ha! ha! one whose foppish nature might seem
  great, only for wise men's recreation; and, like a juiceless
  bark, to preserve the sap of more strenuous spirits.
  A servile hound, that loves the scent of forerunning
  fashion, like an empty hollow vault, still giving an echo
  to wit: greedily champing what any other well valued
  judgment had beforehand chew'd.[37]                              40

  _Foro._ Ha! ha! ha! tolerably good, good faith, sweet
  wag.

  _Alb._ Umph; why tolerably good, good faith, sweet
  wag? Go, go; you flatter me.

  _Foro._ Right; I but dispose my speech to the habit
  of my part.

  _Alb._ Why, what plays he?                           [_To_ FELICHE.

  _Feli._ The wolf that eats into the breasts of princes;
  that breeds the lethargy and falling sickness in honour;
  makes justice look asquint; and blinds[38] the eye of
  merited reward from viewing desertful virtue.                    51

  _Alb._ What's all this periphrasis, ha?

  _Feli._ The substance of a supple-chapt flatterer.

  _Alb._ O! doth he play Forobosco the Parasite? Good,
  i'faith. Sirrah, you must seem now as glib and straight
  in outward semblance as a lady's busk,[39] though inwardly
  as cross as a pair of tailors' legs; having a tongue as
  nimble as his needle, with servile patches of glavering
  flattery to stitch up the bracks[40] of unworthily
  honour'd--                                                       60

  _Foro._ I warrant you, I warrant you, you shall see me
  prove the very periwig to cover the bald pate of brainless
  gentility. Ho! I will so tickle the sense of _bella
  gratiosa madonna_ with the titillation of hyperbolical praise,
  that I'll strike it in the nick, in the very nick, chuck.

  _Feli._ Thou promisest more than I hope any spectator
  gives faith of performance; but why look you so dusky,
  ha?                                                  [_To_ ANTONIO.

  _Ant._ I was never worse fitted since the nativity of my
  actorship; I shall be hiss'd at, on my life now.                 70

  _Feli._ Why, what must you play?

  _Ant._ Faith, I know not what; an hermaphrodite, two
  parts in one; my true person being Antonio, son to the
  Duke of Genoa; though for the love of Mellida, Piero's
  daughter, I take this feigned presence of an Amazon,
  calling myself Florizell, and I know not what. I a voice
  to play a lady! I shall ne'er do it.

  _Alb._ O! an Amazon should have such a voice,
  virago-like. Not play two parts in one? away, away,
  'tis common fashion. Nay, if you cannot bear two
  subtle fronts under one hood, idiot, go by, go by, off
  this world's stage! O time's impurity!                           82

  _Ant._ Ay, but when use hath taught me action
  To hit the right point of a lady's part,
  I shall grow ignorant, when I must turn
  Young prince again, how but to truss[41] my hose.

  _Feli._ Tush, never put them off; for women wear the
  breeches still.

  _Mat._ By the bright honour of a Milanoise,
  And the resplendent fulgor of this steel,                        90
  I will defend the feminine to death,
  And ding[42] his spirit to the verge of hell,
  That dares divulge a lady's prejudice!

                  [_Exeunt_ MATZAGENTE, FOROBOSCO, _and_ BALURDO.[43]

  _Feli._ Rampum scrampum, mount tufty Tamburlaine!
  What rattling thunderclap breaks from his lips?

  _Alb._ O! 'tis native to his part. For acting a modern[44]
  braggadoch under the person of Matzagente, the Duke
  of Milan's son, it may seem to suit with good fashion
  of coherence.                                                    99

  _Pier._ But methinks he speaks with a spruce Attic
  accent of adulterate Spanish.

  _Alb._ So 'tis resolv'd. For Milan being half Spanish,
  half high Dutch, and half Italians, the blood of chiefest
  houses is corrupt and mongrel'd; so that you shall see
  a fellow vain-glorious for a Spaniard, gluttonous for a
  Dutchman, proud for an Italian, and a fantastic idiot
  for all. Such a one conceit this Matzagente.

  _Feli._ But I have a part allotted me, which I have
  neither able apprehension to conceit, nor what I conceit
  gracious ability to utter.                                      110

  _Gal._ Whoop, in the old cut![45] Good, show us a
  draught of thy spirit.

  _Feli._ 'Tis steady and must seem so impregnably fortressed
  with his own content that no envious thought
  could ever invade his spirit; never surveying any man
  so unmeasuredly happy, whom I thought not justly
  hateful for some true impoverishment; never beholding
  any favour of Madam Felicity gracing another, which
  his well-bounded content persuaded not to hang in
  the front of his own fortune; and therefore as far
  from envying any man, as he valued all men infinitely
  distant from accomplished beatitude. These native
  adjuncts appropriate to me the name of Feliche. But
  last, good, thy humour.                                         124

                        [_Exeunt_ PIERO, ALBERTO, _and_ GALEATZO.[46]

  _Ant._ 'Tis to be described by signs and tokens. For
  unless I were possessed with a legion of spirits, 'tis
  impossible to be made perspicuous by any utterance:
  for sometimes he must take austere state, as for the
  person of Galeatzo, the son of the Duke of Florence,
  and possess his exterior presence with a formal majesty:
  keep popularity in distance, and on the sudden fling
  his honour so prodigally into a common arm, that he
  may seem to give up his indiscretion to the mercy of
  vulgar censure. Now as solemn as a traveller,[47] and as
  grave as a Puritan's ruff;[48] with the same breath as
  slight and scattered in his fashion as a--a--anything;
  now as sweet and neat as a barber's casting-bottle;[49]
  straight as slovenly as the yeasty breast of an ale-knight:
  now lamenting, then chafing, straight laughing,
  then----.                                                       140

  _Feli._ What then?

  _Ant._ Faith, I know not what; 't had been a right
  part for Proteus or Gew. Ho! blind Gew[50] would ha'
  done 't rarely, rarely.

  _Feli._ I fear it is not possible to limn so many persons
  in so small a tablet as the compass of our plays
  afford.

  _Ant._ Right! therefore I have heard that those persons,
  as he and you, Feliche, that are but slightly drawn
  in this comedy, should receive more exact accomplishment
  in a second part; which, if this obtain gracious
  acceptance, means to try his fortune.                           151

  _Feli._ Peace, here comes the Prologue: clear the stage.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [35] We have an Induction before _What you Will_ and _The
     Malcontent_. Ben Jonson was particularly fond of introducing
     preliminary dialogues, which are usually so tedious that we are
     fain to exclaim with Cordatus (in the Induction to _Every Man
     out of his Humour_), "I would they would begin once; this
     protraction is able to sour the best settled patience in the
     theatre."

     [36] _I.e._, the poverty of the theatrical company. It was
     common for an actor to represent two characters (or more) in the
     same play. For example, William Shurlock personated Maharbal and
     Prusias in Nabbes' _Hannibal and Scipio_, 1635; and in the
     same play, Hugh Clerke, besides taking the part of Syphax,
     personated the Nuntius.

     [37] Old eds. "shew'd."

     [38] So ed. 1633.--The 4to gives "blinks."

     [39] A piece of whalebone, steel, or wood worn down the front of
     the stays to keep them straight.

     [40] Rents, cracks.

     [41] "Truss my hose" = tie the tagged laces of my breeches.

     [42] Hurl violently.

     [43] Old eds. "_Exeunt_ ANT. _and_
     ALB."

     [44] Common, worthless.--The use of "modern" in this sense is
     frequently found, and was sanctioned by Shakespeare; but it did
     not escape Ben Jonson's censure in _The Poetaster_, v. i.:--
          "Alas! that were no _modern_ consequence
          To have cothurnal buskins frightened hence."

     [45] "The old cut" = the old fashion. So Nashe in the epistle
     dedicatory prefixed to _Strange News of the Intercepting
     Certain Letters_, 1593:--"You are amongst grave Doctors and
     men of judgment in both laws every day. I pray ask them the
     question in my absence whether such a man as I have described
     this epistler to be ... that hath made many proper rhymes of the
     _old cut_ in his days," &c.

     [46] Old eds. "_Exit_ ALB."

     [47] "Jaques in _As You Like It_, describing his own
     melancholy, says it is extracted from many objects, and that the
     contemplation of his travels often wraps him in a most humorous
     sadness: on which Rosalind observes--'A traveller! by my faith
     you have great reason to be sad!'"--_Dilke._

     [48] The Puritans' short starched ruffs were constantly
     ridiculed. See Middleton's _Works_, viii. 69.

     [49] A bottle for sprinkling perfumes.

     [50] Probably an actor who had gone blind; but I can find no
     information about him.




                           THE PROLOGUE.


  The wreath of pleasure and delicious sweets,
  Begirt the gentle front of this fair troop!
  Select and most respected auditors,
  For wit's sake do not dream of miracles.
  Alas! we shall but falter, if you lay
  The least sad weight of an unus�d hope
  Upon our weakness; only we give up
  The worthless present of slight idleness
  To your authentic censure. O! that our Muse
  Had those abstruse and sinewy faculties,                         10
  That, with a strain of fresh invention,
  She might press out the rarity of Art;
  The pur'st elix�d juice of rich conceit
  In your attentive ears; that with the lip
  Of gracious elocution we might drink
  A sound carouse into your health of wit.
  But O! the heavy[51] dryness of her brain,
  Foil to your fertile spirits, is asham'd
  To breathe her blushing numbers to such ears.
  Yet (most ingenious) deign to veil our wants;                    20
  With sleek acceptance polish these rude scenes;
  And if our slightness your large hope beguiles,
  Check not with bended brow, but dimpled smiles.

                                                    [_Exit_ Prologue.


     [51] So ed. 1633.--Ed. 1602 "heathy."




                          THE FIRST PART

                                 OF

                       ANTONIO AND MELLIDA.




                              ACT I.


                             SCENE I.

                       _Neighbourhood of Venice._

                 _The cornets sound a battle within._

             _Enter_ ANTONIO, _disguised like an Amazon_.

  _Ant._ Heart, wilt not break? and thou abhorr�d life,
  Wilt thou still breathe in my enrag�d blood?
  Veins, sinews, arteries, why crack ye not,
  Burst and divulst with anguish of my grief?
  Can man by no means creep out of himself,
  And leave the slough of viperous grief behind?
  Antonio, hast thou seen a fight at sea,
  As horrid as the hideous day of doom,
  Betwixt thy father, Duke of Genoa,
  And proud Piero, the Venetian Prince:                            10
  In which the sea hath swoln with Genoa's blood,
  And made spring-tides with the warm reeking gore,
  That gush'd from out our galleys' scupper-holes?
  In which thy father, poor Andrugio,
  Lies sunk, or leap'd into the arms of chance,
  Choked with the labouring ocean's brackish foam;
  Who, even despite Piero's canker'd hate,
  Would with an arm�d hand have seized thy love,
  And link'd thee to the beauteous Mellida.
  Have I outlived the death of all these hopes?                    20
  Have I felt anguish pour'd into my heart,
  Burning like balsamum in tender wounds!
  And yet dost live! Could not the fretting sea
  Have roll'd me up in wrinkles of his brow?
  Is death grown coy, or grim confusion nice,
  That it will not accompany a wretch,
  But I must needs be cast on Venice' shore,
  And try new fortunes with this strange disguise
  To purchase my ador�d Mellida?

                              [_The cornets sound a flourish; cease._

  Hark how Piero's triumphs beat the air!                          30
  O, rugged mischief, how thou grat'st my heart!--
  Take spirit, blood; disguise, be confident;
  Make a firm stand; here rests the hope of all:
  Lower than hell, there is no depth to fall.

  _The cornets sound a senet. Enter_ FELICHE _and_ ALBERTO, CASTILIO
    _and_ FOROBOSCO, _a_ Page _carrying a shield_; PIERO _in armour_;
    CATZO _and_ DILDO _and_ BALURDO. _All these_ (_saving_ PIERO)
    _armed with petronels_.[52] _Being entered, they make a stand in
    divided files_.

  _Pier._ Victorious Fortune, with triumphant hand,
  Hurleth my glory 'bout this ball of earth,
  Whilst the Venetian Duke is heav�d up
  On wings of fair success, to overlook
  The low-cast ruins of his enemies,
  To see myself adored and Genoa quake;                            40
  My fate is firmer than mischance can shake.

  _Feli._ Stand; the ground trembleth.

  _Pier._ Ha! an earthquake?

  _Bal._ O! I smell a sound.

  _Feli._ Piero, stay, for I descry a fume
  Creeping from out the bosom of the deep,
  The breath of darkness, fatal when 'tis wist
  In greatness' stomach. This same smoke, call'd pride,
  Take heed: she'll lift thee to improvidence,
  And break thy neck from steep security;                          50
  She'll make thee grudge to let Jehovah share
  In thy successful battles. O! she's ominous;
  Enticeth princes to devour heaven,
  Swallow omnipotence, out-stare dread fate,
  Subdue eternity in giant thought;
  Heaves[53] up their heart[54] with swelling, puff'd conceit,
  Till their souls burst with venom'd arrogance.
  Beware, Piero; Rome itself hath tried,
  Confusion's train blows up this Babel pride.

  _Pier._ Pish! _Dimitto superos, summa votorum attigi._[55]       60
  Alberto, hast thou yielded up our fix'd decree
  Unto the Genoan ambassador?
  Are they content, if that their Duke return,
  To send his and his son Antonio's head,
  As pledges steep'd in blood, to gain their peace?

  _Alb._ With most obsequious sleek-brow'd entertain,
  They all embrace it as most gracious.

  _Pier._ Are proclamations sent through Italy,
  That whosoever brings Andrugio's head,
  Or young Antonio's, shall be guerdon�d                           70
  With twenty thousand double pistolets,
  And be endear�d to Piero's love?

  _Foro._ They are sent every way: sound policy,
  Sweet lord.

  _Feli._ [_Aside._] Confusion to these limber sycophants!
  No sooner mischiefs born in regency,
  But flattery christens it with policy.[56]

  _Pier._ Why, then,--_O me coelitum excelsissimum!_
  The intestine malice and inveterate hate
  I always bore to that Andrugio,                                  80
  Glories in triumph o'er his misery;
  Nor shall that carpet-boy[57] Antonio
  Match with my daughter, sweet-cheek'd Mellida.
  No; the public power makes my faction strong.

  _Feli._ Ill, when public power strength'neth private wrong.

  _Pier._ 'Tis horse-like not for man to know his force.

  _Feli._ 'Tis god-like for a man to feel remorse.[58]

  _Pier._ Pish! I prosecute my family's revenge,
  Which I'll pursue with such a burning chase,
  Till I have dried up all Andrugio's blood;                       90
  Weak rage, that with slight pity is withstood.--

                                     [_The cornets sound a flourish._

  What means that fresh triumphal flourish sound?

  _Alb._ The prince of Milan, and young Florence' heir,
  Approach to gratulate your victory.

  _Pier._ We'll girt them with an ample waste of love.
  Conduct them to our presence royally;
  Let vollies of the great artillery
  From off our galleys' banks[59] play prodigal,
  And sound loud welcome from their bellowing mouths.

                                             [_Exeunt all but_ PIERO.

  _The cornets sound a senet. Enter above_, MELLIDA, ROSSALINE,
    _and_ FLAVIA. _Enter below_, GALEATZO _with Attendants_; PIERO
    _meeteth him, embraceth; at which the cornets sound a flourish_;
    PIERO _and_ GALEATZO _exeunt; the rest stand still_.

  _Mel._ What prince was that passed through my father's guard?   100

  _Fla._ 'Twas Galeatzo, the young Florentine.

  _Ros._ Troth, one that will besiege thy maidenhead;
  Enter the walls, i'faith (sweet Mellida),
  If that thy flankers be not cannon-proof.

  _Mel._ O, Mary Ambree,[60] good, thy judgment, wench?
  Thy bright election's clear:[61] what will he prove?

  _Ros._ Hath a short finger and a naked chin,
  A skipping eye; dare lay my judgment (faith)
  His love is glibbery;[62] there's no hold on't, wench.
  Give me a husband whose aspect is firm;                         110
  A full-cheek'd gallant with a bouncing thigh:
  O, he is the _Paradizo dell madonne contento_.

  _Mel._ Even such a one was my Antonio.

                                        [_The cornets sound a senet._

  _Ros._ By my nine and thirtieth servant, sweet,
  Thou art in love; but stand on tiptoe,[63] fair;
  Here comes Saint Tristram Tirlery Whiffe, i'faith.

  _Enter_ MATZAGENTE; PIERO _meets him, embraceth; at which the
    cornets sound a flourish: they two stand, using seeming
    compliments, whilst the scene passeth above_.

  _Mel._ St. Mark, St. Mark! what kind of thing appears?

  _Ros._ For fancy's passion, spit upon him! Fie,
  His face is varnish'd. In the name of love,
  What country bred that creature?

  _Mel._ What is he, Flavia?                                      120

  _Fla._ The heir of Milan, Signior Matzagente.

  _Ros._ Matzagente! now, by my pleasure's hope,
  He is made like a tilting-staff; and looks
  For all the world like an o'er-roasted pig:
  A great tobacco-taker too, that's flat;
  For his eyes look as if they had been hung
  In the smoke of his nose.

  _Mel._ What husband will he prove, sweet Rossaline?

  _Ros._ Avoid him; for he hath a dwindled leg,
  A low forehead, and a thin coal-black beard;                    130
  And will be jealous too, believe it, sweet;
  For his chin sweats, and hath a gander neck,
  A thin lip, and a little monkish eye.
  'Precious! what a slender waist he hath!
  He looks like a may-pole,[64] or a notched stick;
  He'll snap in two at every little strain.
  Give me a husband that will fill mine arms,
  Of steady judgment, quick and nimble sense;
  Fools relish not a lady's excellence.

  [_Exeunt all on the lower stage; at which the cornets sound a
    flourish, and a peal of shot is given._

  _Mel._ The triumph's ended; but look, Rossaline!                140
  What gloomy soul in strange accustrements[65]
  Walks on the pavement?

  _Ros._ Good sweet, let's to her; prithee, Mellida.

  _Mel._ How covetous thou art of novelties!

  _Ros._ Pish! 'tis our nature to desire things
  That are thought strangers to the common cut.

  _Mel._ I am exceeding willing, but----

  _Ros._ But what? prithee, go down; let's see her face:
  God send that neither wit nor beauty wants,
  Those tempting sweets, affection's adamants.                    150

                                                           [_Exeunt._

  _Ant._ Come down: she comes like--O, no simile
  Is precious, choice, or elegant enough
  To illustrate her descent! Leap heart, she comes!
  She comes! smile heaven, and softest southern wind
  Kiss her cheek gently with perfum�d breath.
  She comes! creation's purity, admir'd,
  Ador'd amazing rarity, she comes!
  O, now, Antonio, press thy spirit forth
  In following passion, knit thy senses close,
  Heap up thy powers, double all thy man.                         160

             _Enter_ MELLIDA, ROSSALINE, _and_ FLAVIA.

  She comes!
  O, how her eyes dart wonder on my heart!
  Mount blood! soul to my lips! taste Hebe's cup:
  Stand firm on deck, when beauty's close fight's[66] up.

  _Mel._ Lady, your strange habit doth beget
  Our pregnant thoughts, even great of much desire,
  To be acquaint with your condition.

  _Ros._ Good, sweet lady, without more ceremonies,
  What country claims your birth? and, sweet, your name?

  _Ant._ In hope your bounty will extend itself                   170
  In self-same nature of fair courtesy,
  I'll shun all niceness; my name's Florizell,
  My country Scythia; I am Amazon,
  Cast on this shore by fury of the sea.

  _Ros._ Nay, faith, sweet creature, we'll not veil our names.
  It pleas'd the font to dip me Rossaline;
  That lady bears the name of Mellida,
  The Duke of Venice' daughter.

  _Ant._ Madam, I am oblig'd to kiss your hand,
  By imposition of a now dead man.                                180

                                   [_To_ MELLIDA, _kissing her hand_.

  _Ros._ Now, by my troth, I long, beyond all thought,
  To know the man; sweet beauty, deign his name.

  _Ant._ Lady, the circumstance is tedious.

  _Ros._ Troth, not a whit; good fair, let's have it all:
  I love not, I, to have a jot left out,
  If the tale come from a loved orator.

  _Ant._ Vouchsafe me, then, your hush'd observances.--
  Vehement in pursuit of strange novelties,
  After long travel through the Asian main,
  I shipp'd my hopeful thoughts for Brittany;[67]                 190
  Longing to view great Nature's miracle,
  The glory of our sex, whose fame doth strike
  Remotest ears with adoration.
  Sailing some two months with inconstant winds,
  We view'd the glistering Venetian forts,
  To which we made: when lo! some three leagues off,
  We might descry a horrid spectacle;
  The issue of black fury strew'd the sea
  With tatter'd carcasses of splitted ships,
  Half sinking, burning, floating topsy-turvy.                    200
  Not far from these sad ruins of fell rage,
  We might behold a creature press the waves;
  Senseless he sprawl'd, all notch'd with gaping wounds.
  To him we made, and (short) we took him up;
  The first thing he spake was,--Mellida!
  And then he swooned.[68]

  _Mel._ Ay me!

  _Ant._ Why sigh you, fair?

  _Mel._[69] Nothing but little humours; good sweet, on.

  _Ant._ His wounds being dress'd, and life recover�d,
  We 'gan discourse; when lo! the sea grew mad,
  His bowels rumbling with wind-passion;                          210
  Straight swarthy darkness popp'd out Phoebus' eye,
  And blurr'd the jocund face of bright-cheek'd day;
  Whilst crudled[70] fogs masked even darkness' brow:
  Heaven bad's good night, and the rocks groan'd
  At the intestine uproar of the main.
  Now gusty flaws strook up the very heels
  Of our mainmast, whilst the keen lightning shot
  Through the black bowels of the quaking air;
  Straight chops a wave, and in his sliftred[71] paunch
  Down falls our ship, and there he breaks his neck;              220
  Which in an instant up was belkt again.
  When thus this martyr'd soul began to sigh:
  "Give me your hand (quoth he): now do you grasp
  Th' unequall'd[72] mirror of ragg'd misery:
  Is't not a horrid storm? O, well-shaped sweet,
  Could your quick eye strike through these gash�d wounds,
  You should behold a heart, a heart, fair creature,
  Raging more wild than is this frantic sea.
  Wolt[73] do me a favour? if thou chance survive,
  But visit Venice, kiss the precious white                       230
  Of my most,--nay, all epithets are base
  To attribute to gracious Mellida:
  Tell her the spirit of Antonio
  Wisheth his last gasp breath'd upon her breast."

  _Ros._ Why weeps soft-hearted Florizell?

  _Ant._ Alas, the flinty rocks groan'd at his plaints.
  "Tell her, (quoth he) that her obdurate sire
  Hath crack'd his bosom;" therewithal he wept,
  And thus sigh'd on: "The sea is merciful;
  Look how it gapes to bury all my grief!                         240
  Well, thou shalt have it, thou shalt be his tomb:
  My faith in my love live; in thee, die woe;
  Die, unmatch'd anguish, die, Antonio!"
  With that he totter'd from the reeling deck,
  And down he sunk.

  _Ros._ Pleasure's body! what makes my Lady weep?

  _Mel._ Nothing, sweet Rossaline, but the air's sharp[74]--
  My father's palace, Madam, will be proud
  To entertain your presence, if you'll deign
  To make repose within. Ay me!                                   250

  _Ant._ Lady, our fashion is not curious.[75]

  _Ros._ 'Faith, all the nobler, 'tis more generous.

  _Mel._ Shall I then know how fortune fell at last,
  What succour came, or what strange fate ensued?

  _Ant._ Most willingly: but this same court is vast,
  And public to the staring multitude.

  _Ros._ Sweet Lady, nay good sweet, now by my troth
  We'll be bedfellows: dirt on compliment froth![76]

     [60] The famous Amazon, whose "valorous acts performed at Gaunt"

     name was commonly applied to any woman of spirit.

     [61] "Thy bright election's clear" = you are a woman of keen
     perception.

     [62] A favourite word with Marston. It is ridiculed by Ben Jonson
     in _The Poetaster_, v. 1:--
          "What, shall thy lubrical and _glibbery_ muse
          Live, as she were defunct, like punk in stews?"

     [63] Old eds. "tiptoed."

     [64] It was a common form of abuse to compare a person to a

                              ACT II.


                             SCENE I.

                  _Palace of the Duke of Venice._

    _Enter_ CATZO, _with a capon eating_; DILDO _following him_.

  _Dil._ Hah, Catzo, your master wants a clean trencher:
  do you hear?
  Balurdo calls for your diminutive attendance.

  _Cat._ The belly hath no ears,[77] Dildo.

  _Dil._ Good pug,[78] give me some capon.

  _Cat._ No capon, no not a bit, ye smooth bully;[78]
  capon's no meat for Dildo: milk, milk, ye glibbery urchin,
  is food for infants.

  _Dil._ Upon mine honour.

  _Cat._ Your honour with a paugh! 'slid, now every jackanapes
  loads his back with the golden coat of honour;
  every ass puts on the lion's skin and roars his honour.
  Upon your honour? By my lady's pantable,[79] I fear I shall
  live to hear a vintner's boy cry, "'Tis rich neat canary."
  Upon my honour!                                                  14

  _Dil._ My stomach's up.

  _Cat._ I think thou art hungry.

  _Dil._ The match of fury is lighted, fastened to the
  linstock[80] of rage, and will presently set fire to the touch-hole
  of intemperance, discharging the double culverin of
  my incensement in the face of thy opprobrious speech.

  _Cat._ I'll stop the barrel thus: good Dildo, set not fire
  to the touch-hole.                                               22

  _Dil._ My rage is stopp'd, and I will eat to the health
  of the fool, thy master Castilio.

  _Cat._ And I will suck the juice of the capon, to the
  health of the idiot, thy master Balurdo.

  _Dil._ Faith, our masters are like a case[81] of rapiers
  sheathed in one scabbard of folly.

  _Cat._ Right Dutch blades. But was't not rare sport at
  the sea-battle, whilst rounce robble hobble roared from
  the ship-sides, to view our masters pluck their plumes
  and drop their feathers, for fear of being men of mark.          32

  _Dil._ 'Slud (cried Signior Balurdo), O for Don
  Rosicleer's[82] armour, in the _Mirror of Knighthood_! what
  coil's here? O for an armour, cannon-proof! O, more
  cable, more featherbeds![83] more featherbeds, more cable!
  till he had as much as my cable-hatband[84] to fence
  him.

           _Enter_ FLAVIA _in haste, with a rebato_.[85]

  _Cat._ Buxom Flavia, can you sing? song, song!

  _Fla._ My sweet Dildo, I am not for you at this time:
  Madam Rossaline stays for a fresh ruff to appear in the
  presence: sweet, away.                                           41

  _Dil._ 'Twill not be so put off, delicate, delicious, spark-eyed,
  sleek-skinn'd, slender-waisted, clean-legg'd, rarely-shaped--

  _Fla._ Who? I'll be at all your service another season:
  my faith, there's reason in all things.

  _Dil._ Would I were reason then, that I might be in all
  things.

  _Cat._ The breve and the semiquaver is, we must have
  the descant you made upon our names, ere you depart.

  _Fla._ Faith, the song will seem to come off hardly.             51

  _Cat._ Troth not a wit, if you seem to come off quickly.

  _Fla._ Pert Catzo, knock[86] it lustily then.

                                                           [_A song._

  _Enter_ FOROBOSCO, _with two torches_: CASTILIO _singing
    fantastically_; ROSSALINE _running a coranto[87] pace, and_
    BALURDO; FELICHE _following, wondering at them all_.

  _Foro._ Make place, gentlemen; pages, hold torches;
  the prince approacheth the presence.

  _Dil._ What squeaking cart-wheel have we here? ha!
  "Make place, gentlemen; pages, hold torches; the prince
  approacheth the presence."

  _Ros._ Faugh, what a strong scent's here! somebody
  useth to wear socks.                                             60

  _Bal._ By this fair candle light, 'tis not my feet; I never
  wore socks since I sucked pap.

  _Ros._ Savourly put off.

  _Cast._ Hah, her wit stings, blisters, galls off the skin
  with the tart acrimony of her sharp quickness: by sweetness,
  she is the very Pallas that flew out of Jupiter's
  brainpan. Delicious creature, vouchsafe me your service:
  by the purity of bounty, I shall be proud of such bondage.

  _Ros._ I vouchsafe it; be my slave.--Signior Balurdo,
  wilt thou be my servant, too?                                    70

  _Bal._ O God,[88] forsooth in very good earnest, law, you
  would make me as a man should say, as a man should
  say--

  _Feli._ 'Slud, sweet beauty, will you deign him your
  service?

  _Ros._ O, your fool is your only servant. But, good
  Feliche, why art thou so sad? a penny for thy thought,
  man.

  _Feli._ I sell not my thought so cheap: I value my
  meditation at a higher rate.                                     80

  _Bal._ In good sober sadness, sweet mistress, you should
  have had my thought for a penny: by this crimson satin
  that cost eleven shillings, thirteen pence, three pence
  halfpenny a yard, that you should, law!

  _Ros._ What was thy thought, good servant?

  _Bal._ Marry forsooth, how many strike of pease would
  feed a hog fat against Christtide.

  _Ros._ Paugh! [_she spits_] servant,[89] rub out my rheum, it
  soils the presence.

  _Cast._ By my wealthiest thought, you grace my shoe
  with an unmeasured honour: I will preserve the sole of
  it, as a most sacred relic for this service.                     92

  _Ros._ I'll spit in thy mouth, and thou wilt, to grace thee.

  _Feli._ [_Aside._] O that the stomach of this queasy age
  Digests, or brooks such raw unseasoned gobs,
  And vomits not them forth! O! slavish sots!
  Servant, quoth you? faugh! if a dog should crave
  And beg her service, he should have it straight:
  She'd give him favours too, to lick her feet,
  Or fetch her fan, or some such drudgery:                        100
  A good dog's office, which these amorists
  Triumph of: 'tis rare, well give her more ass,
  More sot, as long as dropping of her nose
  Is sworn rich pearl by such low slaves as those.

  _Ros._ Flavia, attend me to attire me.

                                    [_Exeunt_ ROSSALINE _and_ FLAVIA.

  _Bal._ In sad good earnest, sir, you have touched the
  very bare of naked truth; my silk stocking hath a good
  gloss, and I thank my planets, my leg is not altogether
  unpropitiously shaped. There's a word: unpropitiously?
  I think I shall speak unpropitiously as well as any courtier
  in Italy.                                                       111

  _Foro._ So help me your sweet bounty, you have the
  most graceful presence, applausive elecuty, amazing volubility,
  polish'd adornation, delicious affability.

  _Feli._ Whoop: fut, how he tickles yon trout under the
  gills! you shall see him take him by and by with groping
  flattery.

  _Foro._ That ever ravish'd the ear of wonder. By your
  sweet self, than whom I know not a more exquisite, illustrate,
  accomplished, pure, respected, adored, observed,
  precious, real,[90] magnanimous, bounteous--if you have
  an idle rich cast jerkin, or so, it shall not be cast away,
  if--ha! here's a forehead, an eye, a head, a hair, that
  would make a--: or if you have any spare pair of silver
  spurs, I'll do you as much right in all kind offices--

  _Feli._ [_Aside._] Of a kind parasite.

  _Foro._ As any of my mean fortunes shall be able to.

  _Bal._ As I am true Christian now, thou hast won the
  spurs.

  _Feli._ [_Aside._] For flattery.                                130
  O how I hate that same Egyptian louse,
  A rotten maggot, that lives by stinking filth
  Of tainted spirits! vengeance to such dogs,
  That sprout by gnawing senseless carrion!

                         _Enter_ ALBERTO.

  _Alb._ Gallants, saw you my mistress, the lady Rossaline?

  _Foro._ My mistress, the lady Rossaline, left the presence
  even now.

  _Cast._ My mistress, the lady Rossaline, withdrew her
  gracious aspect even now.

  _Bal._ My mistress, the lady Rossaline, withdrew her
  gracious aspect even now.                                       141

  _Feli._ [_Aside._] Well said, echo.

  _Alb._ My mistress, and his mistress, and your mistress,
  and the dog's mistress. Precious dear heaven, that
  Alberto lives to have such rivals!--
  'Slid, I have been searching every private room,
  Corner, and secret angle of the court:
  And yet, and yet, and yet she lives conceal'd.
  Good sweet Feliche, tell me how to find
  My bright-faced mistress out.                                   150

  _Feli._ Why man, cry out for lanthorn and candle-light:[91]
  for 'tis your only way, to find your bright-flaming wench
  with your light-burning torch: for most commonly, these
  light creatures live in darkness.

  _Alb._ Away, you heretic, you'll be burnt for----

  _Feli._ Go, you amorous hound, follow the scent of your
  mistress' shoe; away!

  _Foro._ Make a fair presence; boys, advance your lights;
  the princess makes approach.

  _Bal._ And please the gods, now in very good deed,
  law, you shall see me tickle the measures for the heavens.
  Do my hangers[92] show?                                         162

  _Enter_ PIERO, ANTONIO, MELLIDA, ROSSALINE, GALEATZO, MATZAGENTE,
    ALBERTO, _and_ FLAVIA. _As they enter_, FELICHE _and_ CASTILIO
    _make a rank for the_ DUKE _to pass through_. FOROBOSCO _ushers
    the_ DUKE _to his state_:[93] _then, whilst_ PIERO _speaketh his
    first speech,_ MELLIDA _is taken by_ GALEATZO _and_ MATZAGENTE _to
    dance, they supporting her_: ROSSALINE, _in like manner, by_
    ALBERTO _and_ BALURDO: FLAVIA, _by_ FELICHE _and_ CASTILIO.

  _Pier._ Beauteous Amazon, sit and seat your thoughts
  In the reposure of most soft content.
  Sound music there! Nay, daughter, clear your eyes,
  From these dull fogs of misty discontent:
  Look sprightly, girl. What? though Antonio's drown'd,--
  That peevish dotard on thy excellence,
  That hated issue of Andrugio,--
  Yet may'st thou triumph in my victories;                        170
  Since, lo, the high-born bloods of Italy
  Sue for thy seat of love.--Let[94] music sound!
  Beauty and youth run descant on love's ground.[95]

  _Mat._ Lady, erect your gracious symmetry,
  Shine in the sphere of sweet affection:
  Your eye['s] as heavy, as the heart of night.

  _Mel._ My thoughts are as black as your beard; my
  fortunes as ill-proportioned as your legs; and all the
  powers of my mind as leaden as your wit, and as dusty
  as your face is swarthy.                                        180

  _Gal._ Faith, sweet, I'll lay thee on the lips for that jest.

  _Mel._ I prithee intrude not on a dead man's right.

  _Gal._ No, but the living's just possession:
  Thy lips and love are mine.

  _Mel._ You ne'er took seizin on them yet: forbear.
  There's not a vacant corner of my heart,
  But all is fill'd with dead Antonio's loss.
  Then urge no more; O leave to love at all;
  'Tis less disgraceful not to mount than fall.

  _Mat._ Bright and refulgent lady, deign your ear:               190
  You see this blade,--had it a courtly lip,
  It would divulge my valour, plead my love,
  Justle that skipping feeble amorist
  Out of your love's seat; I am Matzagent.

  _Gal._ Hark thee; I pray thee, taint not thy sweet ear
  With that sot's gabble; by thy beauteous cheek,
  He is the flagging'st bulrush that e'er droop'd
  With each slight mist of rain. But with pleased eye
  Smile on my courtship.

  _Mel._ What said you, sir? alas my thought was fix'd            200
  Upon another object. Good, forbear:
  I shall but weep. Ay me, what boots a tear!
  Come, come, let's dance. O music, thou distill'st
  More sweetness in us than this jarring world:
  Both time and measure from thy strains do breathe,
  Whilst from the channel of this dirt doth flow
  Nothing but timeless grief, unmeasured woe.

  _Ant._ O how impatience cramps my crack�d veins
  And cruddles thick my blood, with boiling rage!
  O eyes, why leap you not like thunderbolts,                     210
  Or cannon bullets in my rival's face!
  _Ohime infeliche misero, O lamentevol fato!_

  _Alb._ What means the lady fall upon the ground?

  _Ros._ Belike the falling sickness.

  _Ant._ I cannot brook this sight, my thoughts grow wild:
  Here lies a wretch, on whom heaven never smiled.

  _Ros._ What, servant, ne'er a word, and I here man?
  I would shoot some speech forth, to strike the time
  With pleasing touch of amorous compliment.
  Say, sweet, what keeps thy mind, what think'st thou on?         220

  _Alb._ Nothing.

  _Ros._ What's that nothing?

  _Alb._ A woman's constancy.

  _Ros._ Good, why, would'st thou have us sluts, and never shift
  The vesture of our thoughts? Away for shame.

  _Alb._ O no, th'art too constant to afflict my heart,
  Too too firm fix�d in unmov�d scorn.

  _Ros._ Pish, pish; I fixed in unmov�d scorn!
  Why, I'll love thee to-night.

  _Alb._ But whom to-morrow?

  _Ros._ Faith, as the toy puts me in the head.

  _Bal._ And pleased the marble heavens, now would I
  might be the toy, to put you in the head, kindly to conceit
  my--my--my--pray you, give in an epithet for love.

  _Feli._ Roaring, roaring.                                       232

  _Bal._[96] O love, thou hast murder'd me, made me a
  shadow, and you hear not Balurdo, but Balurdo's ghost.

  _Ros._ Can a ghost speak?

  _Bal._ Scurvily, as I do.

  _Ros._ And walk?

  _Bal._ After their fashion.

  _Ros._ And eat apples?

  _Bal._ In a sort, in their garb.                                240

  _Feli._ Prithee, Flavia, be my mistress.

  _Fla._ Your reason, good Feliche?

  _Feli._ Faith, I have nineteen mistresses already, and I
  not much disdain that thou should'st make up the full
  score.

  _Fla._ O, I hear you make commonplaces of your mistresses
  to perform the office of memory by. Pray you, in
  ancient times were not those satin hose? In good faith,
  now they are new dyed, pink'd, and scoured, they show
  as well as if they were new. What, mute, Balurdo?               250

  _Feli._ Ay, in faith, and 'twere not for printing, and
  painting, my breech and your face would be out of
  reparation.[97]

  _Bal._ Ay, in[98] faith, and 'twere not for printing, and
  painting,[99] my breech and your face would be out of
  reparation.

  _Feli._ Good again, Echo.

  _Fla._ Thou art, by nature, too foul to be affected.

  _Feli._ And thou, by art, too fair to be beloved.
  By wit's life, most spark spirits, but hard chance.
  _La ty dine._                                                   261

  _Pier._ Gallants, the night grows old; and downy sleep
  Courts us to entertain his company:
  Our tir�d limbs, bruis'd in the morning fight,
  Entreat soft rest, and gentle hush'd repose.
  Fill out Greek wines; prepare fresh cressit-light:[100]
  We'll have a banquet: Princes, then good-night.

                 [_The cornets sound a senet, and the_ DUKE _goes out
                  in state_. _As they are going out_, ANTONIO _stays_
                  MELLIDA: _the rest exeunt_.

  _Ant._ What means these scatter'd looks? why tremble you?
  Why quake your thoughts in your distracted eyes?
  Collect your spirits, Madam; what do you see?                   270
  Dost not behold a ghost?
  Look, look where he stalks, wrapt up in clouds of grief,
  Darting his soul upon thy wond'ring eyes.
  Look, he comes towards thee; see, he stretcheth out
  His wretched arms to gird thy loved waist,
  With a most wish'd embrace: see'st him not yet?
  Nor yet? Ha, Mellida; thou well may'st err:
  For look, he walks not like Antonio:
  Like that Antonio, that this morning shone
  In glistering habiliments of arms,                              280
  To seize his love, spite of her father's spite:
  But like himself, wretched, and miserable,
  Banish'd, forlorn, despairing, strook quite through,
  With sinking grief, rolled up in sevenfold doubles
  Of plagues [un]vanquishable: hark, he speaks to thee.

  _Mel._ Alas, I cannot hear, nor see him.

  _Ant._ Why? all this night about the room he stalk'd,
  And groan'd, and howl'd, with raging passion,
  To view his love (life-blood of all his hopes,
  Crown of his fortune) clipp'd by strangers' arms.               290
  Look but behind thee.

  _Mel._ O Antonio!
  My lord, my love, my----

  _Ant._ Leave passion, sweet; for time, place, air, and earth,
  Are all our foes: fear, and be jealous; fair,
  Let's fly.

  _Mel._ Dear heart, ha, whither?

  _Ant._ O, 'tis no matter whither, but let's fly.
  Ha! now I think on't, I have ne'er a home,
  No father, friend, or country to embrace
  These wretched limbs: the world, the all that is,               300
  Is all my foe: a prince not worth a doit:
  Only my head is hois�d to high rate,
  Worth twenty thousand double pistolets,
  To him that can but strike it from these shoulders.
  But come, sweet creature, thou shalt be my home;
  My father, country, riches, and my friend,
  My all, my soul; and thou and I will live,--
  Let's think like what--and you and I will live
  Like unmatch'd mirrors of calamity.
  The jealous ear of night eave-drops our talk.                   310
  Hold thee, there's a jewel; and look thee, there's a note
  That will direct thee when, where, how to fly.
  Bid me adieu.

  _Mel._ Farewell, bleak misery!

  _Ant._ Stay, sweet, let's kiss before you go!

  _Mel._ Farewell, dear soul!

  _Ant._ Farewell, my life, my heart!

     [82] All the editions give "Bessicler's;" but this is evidently a
     misprint. Rosicleer was the brother of the Knight of the Sun, and
     he figures prominently in the group of romances published under
     the _Mirror of Knighthood_ (7 pts., 1583-1601). He had an
     excellent suit of armour, which proved very serviceable in his
     combats with giants.

     [83] Dilke, in 1814, says that featherbeds were still used to
     protect the men from the fire of the enemy. As to the use of
     cables I refer the reader to Sir William Monson's _Naval
     Tracts_ (_Collection of Voyages and Travels_,
     1704, iii. 358), where in the directions "How to preserve the men
     in fighting" it is stated:--"I prefer the coiling of cables on
     the deck, and keeping part of the men within them...; for the
     soldiers are in and out speedily upon all sudden occasions to
     succour any part of the ship, or to enter an enemy, without
     trouble to the sailors in handling their sails or to the gunners
     in playing their ordnance."

     [84] A twisted band worn round the hat. In _Every Man out of

     [97] There is the same joke in the _Merry Jests of George
     Peele_, 1627:--"George used often to an ordinary in this town,
     where a kinswoman of the good wife's in the house held a great
     pride and vain opinion of her own mother-wit; for her tongue was
     a jack continually wagging.... Now this titmouse, what she
     scanted by nature, she doth replenish by art, as her boxes of red
     and white daily can testify. But to come to George, who arrived
     at the ordinary among other gallants, throws his cloak upon the
     table, salutes the gentlemen, and presently calls for a cup of
     canary. George had a pair of hose on, that for some offence durst
     not to be seen in that hue they were first dyed in, but from his
     first colour being a youthful green, his long age turned him into
     a mournful black, and for his antiquity was in print. Which this
     busybody perceiving, thought now to give it him to the quick; and
     drawing near Master Peele, looking upon his breeches, 'By my
     troth, sir,' quoth she, 'these are exceedingly well printed.' At
     which word, George, being a little moved in his mind that his old
     hose were called in question, answered, 'And by my faith,
     mistress,' quoth George, 'your face is most damnably ill
     painted.' 'How mean you, sir?' quoth she. 'Marry thus, mistress,'
     quoth George, 'that if it were not for printing and painting, my
     arse and your face would grow out of reparations.'"

                             ACT III.


                             SCENE I.

                         _The sea-shore._

  _Enter_ ANDRUGIO _in armour_, LUCIO _with a shepherd's gown in his
                        hand, and a Page_.

  _And._ Is not yon gleam the shuddering morn that flakes
  With silver tincture the east verge of heaven?

  _Lu._ I think it is, so please your excellence.

  _And._ Away! I have no excellence to please.
  Prithee observe the custom of the world,
  That only flatters greatness, states exalts.
  And please my excellence! O Lucio,
  Thou hast been ever held respected dear,
  Even precious to Andrugio's inmost love.
  Good, flatter not. Nay, if thou giv'st not faith                 10
  That I am wretched, O read that, read that.

          PIERO SFORZA _to the_ Italian Princes, _fortune_.

  _Lu._ [reads] _EXCELLENT, the just overthrow_ ANDRUGIO
  _took in the Venetian gulf, hath so assured the Genoways
  of the [in]justice of his cause, and the hatefulness of his
  person, that they have banish'd him and all his family:
  and, for confirmation of their peace with us, have
  vowed, that if he or his son can be attached, to send
  us both their heads. We therefore, by force of our
  united league, forbid you to harbour him, or his blood:
  but if you apprehend his person, we entreat you to send
  him, or his head, to us. For we vow, by the honour
  of our blood, to recompense any man that bringeth his
  head, with twenty thousand double pistolets, and the
  endearing of our choicest love. From_ Venice: PIERO SFORZA.      24

  _And._ My thoughts are fix'd in contemplation
  Why this huge earth, this monstrous animal,
  That eats her children, should not have eyes and ears.
  Philosophy maintains that Nature's wise,
  And forms no useless or unperfect thing.
  Did Nature make the earth, or the earth Nature?                  30
  For earthly dirt makes all things, makes the man,
  Moulds me up honour; and, like a cunning Dutchman,
  Paints me a puppet even with seeming breath,
  And gives a sot appearance of a soul.
  Go to, go to; thou liest, Philosophy.
  Nature forms things unperfect, useless, vain.
  Why made she not the earth with eyes and ears
  That she might see desert, and hear men's plaints?
  That when a soul is splitted, sunk with grief,
  He might fall thus, upon the breast of earth,                    40

                                  [_He throws himself on the ground._

  Exclaiming thus: O thou all-bearing earth,
  Which men do gape for, till thou cramm'st their mouths,
  And chokest their throats with dust; O chaune[101] thy breast,
  And let me sink into thee! Look who knocks;
  Andrugio calls.--But O, she's deaf and blind:
  A wretch but lean relief on earth can find.

  _Lu._ Sweet lord, abandon passion, and disarm.
  Since by the fortune of the tumbling sea,
  We are roll'd up upon the Venice marsh,
  Let's clip all fortune, lest more low'ring fate--                50

  _And._ More low'ring fate! O Lucio, choke that breath.
  Now I defy chance: Fortune's brow hath frown'd,
  Even to the utmost wrinkle it can bend:
  Her venom's spit. Alas, what country rests,
  What son, what comfort that she can deprive?
  Triumphs not Venice in my overthrow?
  Gapes not my native country for my blood?
  Lies not my son tomb'd in the swelling main?
  And yet more low'ring fate! There's nothing left
  Unto Andrugio, but Andrugio:                                     60
  And that nor mischief, force, distress, nor hell can take.
  Fortune my fortunes, not my mind, shall shake.

  _Lu._ Spoke[102] like yourself; but give me leave, my Lord,
  To wish your safety. If you are but seen,
  Your arms display you; therefore put them off,
  And take----.

  _And._ Would'st thou have me go unarm'd among my foes?
  Being besieg'd by passion, ent'ring lists,
  To combat with despair and mighty grief;
  My soul beleaguer'd with the crushing strength                   70
  Of sharp impatience? ha, Lucio, go unarm'd?
  Come soul, resume the valour of thy birth;
  Myself, myself will dare all opposites:[103]
  I'll muster forces, an unvanquish'd power:
  Cornets of horse shall press th' ungrateful earth;
  This hollow womb�d mass shall inly groan,
  And murmur to sustain the weight of arms:
  Ghastly amazement, with upstarted hair,
  Shall hurry on before, and usher us,
  Whilst trumpets clamour with a sound of death.                   80

  _Lu._ Peace, good my Lord, your speech is all too light.
  Alas, survey your fortunes, look what's left
  Of all your forces, and your utmost hopes:
  A weak old man, a page, and your poor self.

  _And._ Andrugio lives, and a fair cause of arms,--
  Why that's an army all invincible!
  He who hath that, hath a battalion royal,
  Armour of proof, huge troops of barb�d steeds,
  Main squares of pikes, millions of harquebush.
  O, a fair cause stands firm, and will abide;                     90
  Legions of angels fight upon her side.[104]

  _Lu._ Then, noble spirit, slide, in strange disguise,
  Unto some gracious Prince, and sojourn there,
  Till time and fortune give revenge firm means.

  _And._ No, I'll not trust the honour of a man.
  Gold is grown great, and makes perfidiousness
  A common waiter in most princes' courts:
  He's in the check-roll;[105] I'll not trust my blood;
  I know none breathing but will cog a die[106]
  For twenty thousand double pistolets.                           100
  How goes the time?

  _Lu._ I saw no sun to-day.[107]

  _And._ No sun will shine, where poor Andrugio breathes.
  My soul grows heavy: boy, let's have a song:
  We'll sing yet, faith, even in[108] despite of fate.

                                                           [_A song._

  _And._ 'Tis a good boy, and by my troth, well sung.
  O, and thou felt'st my grief, I warrant thee,
  Thou would'st have strook division[109] to the height,
  And made the life of music breathe: hold, boy; why so.
  For God's sake call me not Andrugio,
  That I may soon forget what I have been.                        110
  For heaven's name, name not Antonio,
  That I may not remember he was mine.
  Well, ere yon sun set, I'll show myself,
  Worthy my blood. I was a Duke; that's all.
  No[110] matter whither, but from whence we fall.[111]

                                                           [_Exeunt._

     [111] "The situation of Andrugio and Lucio resembles that of Lear
     and Kent, in that King's distresses. Andrugio, like Lear,
     manifests a kind of royal impatience, a turbulent greatness, an
     affected resignation. The enemies which he enters lists to
     combat, 'Despair, and mighty Grief, and sharp Impatience;' and
     the Forces ('Cornets of Horse,' &c.) which he brings to vanquish
     them, are in the boldest style of allegory. They are such a 'race
     of mourners' as 'the infection of sorrows loud' in the intellect
     might beget on 'some pregnant cloud' in the
     imagination."--_Charles Lamb._


                             SCENE II.

                  _Palace of the Duke of Venice._

                _Enter_ FELICHE _walking, unbraced_.

  _Feli._ Castilio, Alberto, Balurdo! none up?
  Forobosco! Flattery, nor thou up yet?
  Then there's no courtier stirring: that's firm truth?
  I cannot sleep: Feliche seldom rests
  In these court lodgings. I have walk'd all night,
  To see if the nocturnal court delights
  Could force me envy their felicity:
  And by plain troth, I will confess plain troth,
  I envy nothing but the travense[112] light.
  O, had it eyes, and ears, and tongues, it might                  10
  See sport, hear speech of most strange surquedries.[113]
  O, if that candle-light were made a poet,
  He would prove a rare firking satirist,
  And draw the core forth of imposthum'd sin.
  Well, I thank heaven yet, that my content
  Can envy nothing, but poor candle-light.
  As for the other glistering copper spangs,
  That glisten in the tire of the court,
  Praise God, I either hate, or pity them.
  Well, here I'll sleep till that the scene of up                  20
  Is pass'd at court. O calm hush'd rich Content,
  Is there a being blessedness without thee?
  How soft thou down'st the couch where thou dost rest,
  Nectar to life, thou sweet Ambrosian feast!

  _Enter_ CASTILIO _and his Page_ CATZO: CASTILIO _with a
    casting-bottle_[114] _of sweet water in his hand, sprinkling
    himself_.

  _Cast._ Am not I a most sweet youth now?

  _Cat._ Yes, when your throat's perfum'd; your very words
  Do smell of ambergris. O stay, sir, stay;
  Sprinkle some sweet water to your shoe's heels,
  That your mistress may swear you have a sweet foot.

  _Cast._ Good, very good, very passing[115] passing good.         30

  _Feli._ Fut, what treble minikin[116] squeaks there, ha?
  "good, very good, very very good!"

  _Cast._ I will warble to the delicious conclave of my
  mistress' ear: and strike her thoughts with the pleasing
  touch of my voice.

                                                           [_A song._

  _Cast._ Feliche, health, fortune, mirth, and wine.

  _Feli._ To thee, my love divine.

  _Cast._ I drink to thee, sweeting.

  _Feli._ [_Aside._] Plague on thee for an ass!

  _Cast._ Now thou hast seen the court, by the perfection
  of it, dost not envy it?                                         41

  _Feli._ I wonder it doth not envy me. Why, man,
  I have been borne upon the spirit's wings,
  The soul's swift Pegasus, the fantasy:
  And from the height of contemplation,
  Have view'd the feeble joints men totter on.
  I envy none; but hate, or pity all.
  For when I view, with an intentive thought,
  That creature fair but proud; him rich, but sot;
  Th' other witty, but unmeasured arrogant;                        50
  Him great, yet boundless in ambition;
  Him high-born, but of base life; t' other fear'd,
  Yet fear�d fears, and fears most to be loved;[117]
  Him wise, but made a fool for public use;
  The other learned, but self-opinionate:
  When I discourse all these, and see myself
  Nor fair, nor rich, nor witty, great, nor fear'd,
  Yet amply suited with all full content,
  Lord, how I clap my hands, and smooth my brow,
  Rubbing my quiet bosom, tossing up                               60
  A grateful spirit to Omnipotence!

  _Cast._ Hah, hah! but if thou knew'st my happiness,
  Thou would'st even grate away thy soul to dust,
  In envy of my sweet beatitude.
  I cannot sleep for kisses; I cannot rest
  For ladies' letters, that importune me
  With such unus�d vehemence of love,
  Straight to solicit them, that----.

  _Feli._ Confusion seize me, but I think thou liest.
  Why should I not be sought to then as well?                      70
  Fut, methinks I am as like a man.
  Troth, I have a good head of hair, a cheek
  Not as yet wan'd, a leg, 'faith, in the full.
  I ha' not a red beard, take not tobacco much:
  And 'slid, for other parts of manliness--

  _Cast._ Pew waw, you ne'er accourted[118] them in pomp,
  Put your good parts in presence graciously.
  Ha, and you had, why, they would ha' come off,
  Sprung to your arms, and sued, and prayed, and vowed,
  And opened all their sweetness to your love.                     80

  _Feli._ There are a number of such things as thou[119]
  Have often urged me to such loose belief;
  But, 'slid, you all do lie, you all do lie.
  I have put on good clothes, and smugg'd my face,
  Strook a fair wench with a smart, speaking eye;
  Courted in all sorts, blunt and passionate;
  Had opportunity, put them to the ah!
  And, by this light, I find them wondrous chaste,
  Impregnable; perchance a kiss, or so:
  But for the rest, O most inexorable!                             90

  _Cast._ Nay then, i'faith, prithee look here.

                 [_Shows him the superscription of a seeming letter._

  _Feli. To her most esteemed, loved, and generous servant,
  Sig. Castilio Balthazar._
  Prithee from whom comes this? faith, I must see.

    _From her that is devoted to thee, in most private sweets
    of love, Rossaline._

  Nay, God's my comfort, I must see the rest;
  I must, sans ceremony; faith, I must.

                           [FELICHE _takes away the letter by force_.

  _Cast._ O, you spoil my ruff, unset my hair; good,
  away!                                                           100

  _Feli. Item, for strait canvass, thirteen pence halfpenny;
  item, for an ell and a half of taffeta to cover your old
  canvass doublet, fourteen shillings and threepence._--'Slight,
  this is a tailor's bill.

  _Cast._ In sooth, it is the outside of her letter, on
  which I took the copy of a tailor's bill.

  _Dil._ But 'tis not cross'd, I am sure of that. Lord have
  mercy on him, his credit hath given up the last gasp.
  Faith, I'll leave him; for he looks as melancholy as a
  wench the first night she----                          [_Exit._ 110

  _Feli._ Honest musk-cod, 'twill not be so stitched together;
  take that [_striking him_], and that, and belie no
  lady's love: swear no more by Jesu, this madam, that
  lady; hence, go, forswear the presence, travel three years
  to bury this bastinado: avoid, puff-paste, avoid!

  _Cast._ And tell not my lady-mother. Well, as I am a
  true gentleman, if she had not willed me on her blessing
  not to spoil my face, if I could not find in my heart to
  fight, would I might ne'er eat a potato-pie more.          [_Exit._

  _Enter_ BALURDO, _backward_; DILDO _following him with a
    looking-glass in one hand, and a candle in the other hand_:
    FLAVIA _following him backward, with a looking-glass in one hand,
    and a candle in the other_; ROSSALINE _following her_; BALURDO
    _and_ ROSSALINE _stand setting of faces; and so the Scene begins_.

  _Feli._ More fool, more rare fools! O, for time and
  place, long enough, and large enough, to act these fools!
  Here might be made a rare scene of folly, if the plat[120]
  could bear it.                                                  123

  _Bal._ By the sugar-candy sky, hold up the glass higher,
  that I may see to swear in fashion. O, one loof[121]
  more would ha' made them shine; God's neaks,[122] they
  would have shone like my mistress' brow. Even so the
  Duke frowns, for all this curson'd[123] world: O, that
  gern[124] kills, it kills. By my golden--what's the richest
  thing about me?                                                130

  _Dil._ Your teeth.

  _Bal._ By my golden teeth, hold up, that I may put in:
  hold up, I say, that I may see to put on my gloves.

  _Dil._ O, delicious, sweet-cheek'd master, if you discharge
  but one glance from the level of that set face, O,
  you will strike a wench; you'll make any wench love
  you.

  _Bal._ By Jesu, I think I am as elegant a courtier as----.
  How likest thou my suit?

  _Cat._ All, beyond all, no peregal:[125] you are wondered
  at--[_Aside._] for an ass.                                      141

  _Bal._ Well, Dildo, no Christen creature shall know
  hereafter, what I will do for thee heretofore.

  _Ros._ Here wants a little white, Flavia.

  _Dil._ Ay, but, master, you have one little fault; you
  sleep open-mouth'd.

  _Bal._ Pew, thou jest'st. In good sadness, I'll have a
  looking-glass nail'd to the testern of the bed, that I may
  see when I sleep whether 'tis so or not; take heed you
  lie not: go to, take heed you lie not.                          150

  _Fla._ By my troth, you look as like the princess, now--Ay--but
  her lip is--lip is--a little----redder, a very
  little redder.

  _Ros._[126] But by the help of art or nature, ere I change my
  periwig, mine shall be as red.

  _Fla._[127] O ay, that face, that eye, that smile, that writhing
  of your body, that wanton dandling of your fan, becomes
  prethely, so sweethly, 'tis even the goodest lady that
  breathes, the most amiable----. Faith, the fringe of your
  satin petticoat is ript. Good faith, madam, they say you
  are the most bounteous lady to your women that ever----O
  most delicious beauty! Good madam, let me kith it.

  _Feli._ Rare sport, rare sport! A female fool, and a
  female flatterer.                                               164

  _Ros._ Body o' me, the Duke! away[128] the glass!

                          _Enter_ PIERO.

  _Pier._ Take up your paper, Rossaline.

  _Ros._ Not mine, my Lord.

  _Pier._ Not yours, my Lady? I'll see what 'tis.

  _Bal._ And how does my sweet mistress? O Lady
  dear, even as 'tis an old say, "'tis an old horse can neither
  wighy,[129] nor wag his tail:" even so do I hold my set face
  still: even so, 'tis a bad courtier that can neither discourse,
  nor blow his nose.                                              173

  _Pier._--[_reads._] _Meet me at Abraham's, the Jew's, where
  I bought my Amazon's disguise. A ship lies in the port,
  ready bound for England; make haste, come private._
                                                      ANTONIO.

                 _Enter_ CASTILIO _and_ FOROBOSCO.

  Forobosco, Alberto, Feliche, Castilio, Balurdo! run, keep
  the palace, post to the ports, go to my daughter's chamber!
  whither now? scud to the Jew's! stay, run to the gates,
  stop the gundolets,[130] let none pass the marsh! do all at
  once! Antonio! his head, his head! Keep you the
  court, the rest stand still, or run, or go, or shout, or search,
  or scud, or call, or hang, or do-do-do su-su-su something!
  I know not who-who-who what I do-do-do, nor who-who-who,
  where I am.                                                     185
     _O trista traditrice, rea ribalda fortuna,
      Negando mi vindetta mi causa fera morte._

                                           [_Exeunt all but_ FELICHE.

  _Feli._ Ha ha ha! I could break my spleen at his
  impatience.

                  _Enter_ ANTONIO _and_ MELLIDA.

  _Ant. Alma et graziosa fortuna siate favorevole,
  Et fortunati siano voti del_[_la_] _mia dolce Mellida, Mellida._

  _Mel._ Alas, Antonio, I have lost thy note!
  A number mount my stairs; I'll straight return.            [_Exit._

  _Feli._ Antonio,                                                194
  Be not affright, sweet Prince; appease thy fear,
  Buckle thy spirits up, put all thy wits
  In wimble[131] action, or thou art surprised.

  _Ant._ I care not.

  _Feli.</i. Art mad, or desperate? or----

  _Ant._ Both, both, all, all: I prithee let me lie;              200
  Spite of you all, I can, and I will die.

  _Feli.</i You are distraught; O, this is madness' breath!

  _Ant._ Each man take[s] hence life, but no man death:
  He's a good fellow, and keeps open house:
  A thousand thousand ways lead to his gate,
  To his wide-mouth�d porch, when niggard life
  Hath[132] but one little, little wicket through.
  We wring ourselves into this wretched world,
  To pule, and weep, exclaim, to curse and rail,
  To fret, and ban the fates, to strike the earth,                210
  As I do now. Antonio, curse thy birth,
  And die!

  _Feli.</i Nay, heaven's my comfort, now you are perverse:
  You know I always loved you; prithee live.
  Wilt thou strike dead thy friends, draw mourning tears?

  _Ant._ Alas, Feliche, I ha' ne'er a friend;
  No country, father, brother, kinsman left
  To weep my fate or sigh my funeral:
  I roll but up and down, and fill a seat
  In the dark cave of dusky misery.                               220

  _Feli._ 'Fore heaven, the Duke comes! hold you, take my key,
  Slink to my chamber; look you, that is it:
  There shall you find a suit I wore at sea;
  Take it, and slip away. Nay, 'precious!
  If you'll be peevish, by this light, I'll swear
  Thou rail'dst upon thy love before thou diedst,
  And call'd her strumpet.

  _Ant._ She'll not credit thee.

  _Feli.</i Tut, that's all one: I will defame thy love,
  And make thy dead trunk held in vile regard.

  _Ant._ Wilt needs have it so? why then, Antonio,                230
  _Vive esperanza in dispetto del fato._                     [_Exit._

         _Enter_ PIERO, GALEATZO, MATZAGENTE, FOROBOSCO,
             BALURDO, _and_ CASTILIO, _with weapons_.

  _Pier._ O, my sweet princes, was't not bravely found?
  Even there I found the note, even there it lay:
  I kiss the place for joy, that there it lay.
  This way he went, here let us make a stand:
  I'll keep this gate myself. O gallant youth!
  I'll drink carouse unto your country's health
  Even in Antonio's skull.

  _Bal._ Lord bless us, his breath is more fearful than a
  sergeant's voice when he cries, I arrest.                       240

             _Enter_ ANTONIO, _disguised as a sailor_.

  _Ant._ Stop Antonio! keep, keep Antonio!

  _Pier._ Where, where, man, where?

  _Ant._ Here, here: let me pursue him down the marsh!

  _Pier._ Hold, there's my signet, take a gundelet:
  Bring me his head, his head, and, by mine honour,
  I'll make thee the wealthiest mariner that breathes.

  _Ant._ I'll sweat my blood out till I have him safe.

  _Pier._ Spoke[133] heartily, i'faith, good mariner.
  O, we will mount in triumph; soon at night,
  I'll set his head up. Let's think where.                        250

  _Bal._ Upon his shoulders, that's the fittest place for it.
  If it be not as fit as if it were made for them, say,--
  Balurdo, thou art a sot, an ass.

            _Enter_ MELLIDA _in Pages attire, dancing_.

  _Pier._ Sprightly, i'faith. In troth he's somewhat like
  My daughter Mellida: but, alas! poor soul,
  Her honour's[134] heels, God knows, are[n't] half so light.

  _Mel._ [_Aside._] Escaped I am, spite of my father's spite. [_Exit._

  _Pier._ Ho, this will warm my bosom ere I sleep.

                     _Enter_ FLAVIA _running_.

  _Fla._ O my Lord, your daughter----

  _Pier._ Ay, ay, my daughter's safe enough, I warrant thee.--    260
  This vengeance on the boy will lengthen out
  My days unmeasuredly.
  It shall be chronicled in time to come,
  Piero Sforza slew Andrugio's son.

  _Fla._ Ay, but, my Lord, your daughter----

  _Pier._ Ay, ay, my good wench, she is safe enough.

  _Fla._ O, then, my Lord, you know she's run away.

  _Pier._ Run away, away! how run away?

  _Fla._ She's vanish'd in an instant, none knows whither.

  _Pier._ Pursue, pursue, fly, run, post, scud away!               270

  _Feli._ [_Sings._] "_And was not good king Salomon_," &c.

  _Pier._ Fly, call, run, row, ride, cry, shout, hurry, haste!
  Haste, hurry, shout, cry, ride, row, run, call, fly,
  Backward and forward, every way about!

  _Mal[e]detta fortuna che[135] dura sorte!
  Che far�, che dir�, pur fugir tanto mal!_

  _Cast._ 'Twas you that struck me even now: was it not?

  _Feli._ It was I that struck you even now.

  _Cast._ You bastinadoed me, I take it.

  _Feli._ I bastinadoed you, and you took it.                     280

  _Cast._ 'Faith, sir, I have the richest tobacco in the court
  for you; I would be glad to make you satisfaction, if I
  have wronged you. I would not the sun should set upon
  your anger; give me your hand.

  _Feli._ Content, faith; so thou'lt breed no more such lies.
  I hate not man, but man's lewd qualities.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [112] So the old eds., but I suspect that the true reading is
     "traverse light," _i.e._, light cast slant-wise.

     [113] Wanton excesses.

     [114] See note 2, p. 13.

     [115] "Passing passing good."--So ed. 1602.--Ed. 1633, "passing
     good."

     [116] Fiddle-string.--Here applied to Castilio's squeaky voice.

     [117] Old eds. "most loved."

     [118] So ed. 1602.--Ed. 1633 "courted."--Dilke gives "accosted";
     but Spenser has the word _accourt_ in Book II. of the
     _Faerie Queene_.

     [119] Old eds. "then."

     [120] Plot of the play.

     [121] There is no meaning in the word "loof:" perhaps we should
     read "one _touch_ more." Balurdo seems to be beautifying
     some part of his person; but his movements are not quite clear.

     [122] "God's neaks"--a meaningless oath constantly used by
     Marston.

     [123] A corruption of _christened_.

     [124] Snarl, grin.--The word is still used in the north country.

     [125] Equal.

     [126] The words "But by the help ... as red," are given to Flavia
     in the old eds.

     [127] Ed. 1633 gives this speech to Balurdo.

     [128] _I.e._, put the glass out of sight.

     [129] Neigh.--Cf. Fletcher's _Women Pleased_, iv. 1:--
          "This beast of Babylon I will never back again;
          His pace is sure prophane, and his lewd _wi-hies_
          The Songs of Hymyn and Gymyn in the wilderness."

     So Ben Jonson in _Every Man out of his Humour_, ii. 1:--"So
     the legerity for that, and the _whig-hie_ and the daggers in
     the nose."

     [130] "Gundolet"--old form of gondola.

     [131] Nimble.--The word is used by Spenser.

     [132] Should we not rather read "Hath but one little wicket
     _thorough which_"?

     [133] Old eds. "Speake."

     [134] Ed. 1. "honour."

     [135] Old eds. "_chy condura sorta_."




                              ACT IV.


                             SCENE I.

                     _Sea-shore near Venice._

            _Enter_ ANTONIO, _in his sea-gown running_.

  _Ant._ Stop, stop Antonio, stay Antonio!
  Vain breath, vain breath, Antonio's lost;
  He cannot find himself, not seize himself.
  Alas, this that you see is not Antonio;
  His spirit hovers in Piero's court,
  Hurling about his agile faculties,
  To apprehend the sight of Mellida:
  But poor, poor soul, wanting apt instruments
  To speak or see, stands dumb and blind, sad spirit,
  Roll'd up in gloomy clouds as black as air                       10
  Through which the rusty coach of Night is drawn.
  'Tis so; I'll give you instance that 'tis so.
  Conceit you me: as having clasp'd a rose[136]
  Within my palm, the rose being ta'en away,
  My hand retains a little breath of sweet:
  So may man's trunk, his spirit slipp'd away,
  Hold[137] still a faint perfume of his sweet guest.
  'Tis so; for when discursive powers fly out,
  And roam in progress through the bounds of heaven,
  The soul itself gallops along with them,                         20
  As chieftain of this wing�d troop of thought,
  Whilst the dull lodge of spirit standeth waste,
  Until the soul return from----. What was't I said?
  O, this is naught but speckling melancholy.
  I have been--
  That Morpheus' tender skinp[138]--Cousin german
  Bear with me, good--
  Mellida: clod upon clod thus fall.
  Hell is beneath, yet heaven is over all.    [_Falls on the ground._

             _Enter_[139] ANDRUGIO, LUCIO, _and_ Page.

  _And._ Come, Lucio, let's go eat: what hast thou got?            30
  Roots, roots? alas, they are seeded, new cut up.
  O, thou hast wrong�d Nature, Lucio:
  But boots not much; thou but pursu'st the world,
  That cuts off virtue, 'fore it comes to growth,
  Lest it should seed, and so o'errun her son,
  Dull purblind error.--Give me water, boy.
  There is no poison in't, I hope; they say
  That lu[r]ks in massy plate: and yet the earth
  Is so infected with a general plague,
  That he's most wise, that thinks there's no man fool;            40
  Right prudent, that esteems no creature just;
  Great policy the least things to mistrust.
  Give me assay[140]----. How we mock greatness now!

  _Lu._ A strong conceit is rich, so most men deem;
  If not to be, 'tis comfort yet to seem.

  _And._ Why man, I never was a prince till now.
  'Tis not the bar�d pate, the bended knees,
  Gilt tipstaves, Tyrrian purple, chairs of state,
  Troops of pied butterflies that flutter still
  In greatness' summer, that confirm a prince:                     50
  'Tis not the unsavoury breath of multitudes,
  Shouting and clapping, with confus�d din,
  That makes a prince. No, Lucio, he's a king,
  A true right king, that dares do aught save wrong;
  Fears nothing mortal but to be unjust;
  Who is not blown up with the flattering puffs
  Of spongy sycophants; who stands unmov'd,
  Despite the justling of opinion;
  Who can enjoy himself, maugre the throng
  That strive to press his quiet out of him;                       60
  Who sits upon Jove's footstool, as I do,
  Adoring, not affecting, majesty;
  Whose brow is wreath�d with the silver crown
  Of clear content: this, Lucio, is a king,
  And of this empire every man's possest
  That's worth his soul.

  _Lu._ My Lord, the Genoways had wont to say--

  _And._ Name not the Genoways: that very word
  Unkings me quite, makes me vile passion's slave.
  O, you that slide[141] upon the glibbery ice                     70
  Of vulgar favour, view Andrugio.
  Was never prince with more applause confirm'd,
  With louder shouts of triumph launch�d out
  Into the surgy main of government;
  Was never prince with more despite cast out,
  Left shipwrack'd, banish'd, on more guiltless ground.
  O rotten props of the crazed multitude,
  How you still double, falter under the lightest chance
  That strains your veins! Alas, one battle lost,
  Your whorish love, your drunken healths, your houts[142]
    and shouts,                                                    80
  Your smooth _God save's_, and all your devils lost[143]
  That tempts our quiet to your hell of throngs!
  Spit on me, Lucio, for I am turn�d slave:
  Observe how passion domineers o'er me.

  _Lu._ No wonder, noble Lord, having lost a son,
  A country, crown, and----.

  _And._ Ay, Lucio, having lost a son, a son,
  A country, house, crown, son. _O lares, miseri[144] lares!_
  Which shall I first deplore? My son, my son,
  My dear sweet boy, my dear Antonio!                              90

  _Ant._ Antonio?

  _And._ Ay, echo, ay; I mean Antonio.

  _Ant._ Antonio, who means Antonio?

  _And._ Where art? what art? know'st thou Antonio?

  _Ant._ Yes.

  _And._ Lives he?

  _Ant._ No.

  _And._ Where lies he dead?

  _Ant._ Here.

  _And._ Where?

  _Ant._ Here.[145]

  _And._ Art thou Antonio?

  _Ant._ I think I am.

  _And._ Dost thou but think? What, dost not know thyself?

  _Ant._ He is a fool that thinks he knows himself.

  _And._ Upon thy faith to heaven, give thy name.                 100

  _Ant._ I were not worthy of Andrugio's blood,
  If I denied my name's Antonio.

  _And._ I were not worthy to be call'd thy father,
  If I denied my name Andrugio.
  And dost thou live? O, let me kiss thy cheek,
  And dew thy brow with trickling drops of joy.
  Now heaven's will be done: for I have lived
  To see my joy, my son Antonio.
  Give me thy hand; now fortune do thy worst,
  His blood, that lapp'd thy spirit in the womb,                  110
  Thus (in his love) will make his arms thy tomb.

  _Ant._ Bless not the body with your twining arms,
  Which is accurs'd of heaven. O, what black sin
  Hath been committed by our ancient house,
  Whose scalding vengeance lights upon our heads,
  That thus the world and fortune casts us out,
  As loath�d objects, ruin's branded slaves!

  _And._ Do not expostulate the heavens' will,
  But, O, remember to forget thyself;
  Forget remembrance what thou once hast been.                    120
  Come, creep with me from out this open air:
  Even trees have tongues, and will betray our life.
  I am a-raising of our house, my boy,
  Which fortune will not envy, 'tis so mean,
  And like the world (all dirt): there shalt thou rip
  The inwards of thy fortunes in mine ears,
  While I sit weeping, blind with passion's tears.
  Then I'll begin, and we'll such order keep,
  That one shall still tell griefs, the other weep.

                    [_Exeunt_ ANDRUGIO _and_ LUCIO, _leaving_ ANTONIO
                       _and the_ Page.

  _Ant_. I'll follow you. Boy, prithee stay a little.             130
  Thou hast had a good voice, if this cold marsh
  Wherein we lurk have not corrupted it.

    _Enter_ MELLIDA, _standing out of sight, in her Page's suit_.

  I prithee sing, but, sirra, (mark you me)
  Let each note breathe the heart of passion,
  The sad extracture of extremest grief.
  Make me a strain speak groaning like a bell
  That tolls departing souls;
  Breathe me a point that may enforce me weep,
  To wring my hands, to break my curs�d breast,
  Rave, and exclaim, lie grovelling on the earth,                 140
  Straight start up frantic, crying, Mellida!
  Sing but, _Antonio hath lost Mellida_,
  And thou shalt see me (like a man possess'd)
  Howl out such passion, that even this brinish marsh
  Will squeeze out tears from out his spongy cheeks:
  The rocks even groan, and----prithee, prithee sing,
  Or I shall ne'er ha' done when I am in;
  'Tis harder for me end, than to begin.

                         [_The Boy runs a note_, ANTONIO _breaks it_.

  For look thee, boy, my grief that hath no end,                  149
  I may begin to plain, but----prithee, sing.

                                                           [_A song._

  _Mel._ Heaven keep you, sir!

  _Ant._ Heaven keep you from me, sir!

  _Mel._ I must be acquainted with you, sir.

  _Ant._ Wherefore? Art thou infected with misery,
  Sear'd with the anguish of calamity?
  Art thou true sorrow, hearty grief? canst weep?
  I am not for thee if thou canst not rave,

                                      [ANTONIO _falls on the ground_.

  Fall flat on the ground, and thus exclaim on heaven:
  O trifling nature, why inspired'st thou breath?

  _Mel._ Stay, sir, I think you nam�d Mellida.

  _Ant._ Know'st thou Mellida?                                    160

  _Mel._ Yes.

  _Ant._ Hast thou seen Mellida?

  _Mel._ Yes.

  _Ant._ Then hast thou seen the glory of her sex,
  The music of Nature, the unequall'd lustre
  Of unmatch'd excellence, the united sweet
  Of heaven's graces, the most ador�d beauty,
  That ever strook amazement in the world!

  _Mel._ You seem to love her.

  _Ant._ With my very soul.

  _Mel._ She'll not requite it: all her love is fix'd             170
  Upon a gallant, one[146] Antonio,
  The Duke of Genoa's son. I was her page,
  And often as I waited, she would sigh,
  O, dear Antonio! and to strengthen thought,
  Would clip my neck, and kiss, and kiss me thus.
  Therefore leave loving her: fa, faith methinks
  Her beauty is not half so ravishing
  As you discourse of; she hath a freckled face,
  A low forehead, and a lumpish eye.                              179

  _Ant._ O heaven, that I should hear such blasphemy!
  Boy, rogue, thou liest! and
  _Spavento del mio cor dolce Mellida,
  Di grave morte ristoro vero, dolce Mellida,
  Celeste salvatrice, sovrana Mellida
  Del mio sperar; trofeo vero Mellida._

  _Mel. Diletta e soave anima mia Antonio,
  Godevole bellezza cortese Antonio.
  Signior mio e virginal amore bell'Antonio,
  Gusto delli miei sensi, car'Antonio._

  _Ant. O svanisce[147] il cor in un soave bacio._                190

  _Mel. Muoiono[148] i sensi nel desiato desio:_

  _Ant. Nel cielo pu� esser belt� pi� chiara?_

  _Mel._ Nel mondo pu�[149] esser belt� pi� chiara?_

  _Ant. Dammi un bacio da quella bocca beata,
  Lasciami[150] coglier l'aura odorata
  Che ha[151] sua seggia in quelle dolci labbra._

  _Mel. Dammi per impero del tuo gradit'amore
  Che bea me con sempiterno honore,
  Cos�, cos� mi converr� morir._
  Good sweet, scout o'er the marsh, for my heart trembles         200
  At every little breath that strikes my ear.
  When thou returnest, then I will discourse
  How I deceiv'd the court; then thou shalt tell
  How thou escaped'st the watch: we'll point our speech
  With amorous kissing[152] commas, and even suck
  The liquid breath from out each other's lips.

  _Ant._ Dull clod, no man but such sweet favour clips.
  I go, and yet my panting blood persuades me stay.
  Turn coward in her sight? away, away!                  [_Exit._ 209

  [_Page._] I think confusion of Babel is fall'n upon those
  lovers, that they change their language; but I fear me,
  my master having but feigned the person of a woman,
  hath got their unfeigned imperfection, and is grown
  double tongued: as for Mellida, she were no woman, if
  she could not yield strange language. But howsoever,
  if I should sit in judgment, 'tis an error easier to be
  pardoned by the auditors, than excused by the authors;
  and yet some private respect may rebate the edge of
  the keener censure.

          _Enter_ PIERO, CASTILIO, MATZAGENTE, FOROBOSCO,
          FELICHE, GALEATZO, _at one door_; BALURDO, _and
                   his_ Page, _at another door_.

  _Pier._ This way she took: search, my sweet gentlemen.
  How now, Balurdo, canst thou meet with anybody?                 221


  _Bal._ As I am true gentleman, I made my horse sweat,
  that he hath ne'er a dry thread on him: and I can meet
  with no living creature, but men and beasts. In good
  sadness,[153] I would have sworn I had seen Mellida even
  now; for I saw a thing stir under a hedge, and I peep'd,
  and I spied a thing, and I peer'd, and I tweer'd[154] underneath:
  and truly a right wise man might have been deceived,
  for it was----.

  _Pier._ What, in the name of heaven?                            230

  _Bal._ A dun cow.

  _Feli._ Sh'ad ne'er a kettle[155] on her head?

  _Pier._ Boy, did'st thou see a young lady pass this way?

  _Gal._ Why speak you not?

  _Bal._ God's neaks, proud elf, give the Duke reverence!
  Stand bare with a----.
  Whogh! heavens bless me! Mellida, Mellida!

  _Pier._ Where man, where?

  _Bal._ Turned man, turned man; women wear the breeches.
  Lo, here!                                                       240

  _Pier._ Light and unduteous! kneel not, peevish elf;
  Speak not, entreat not, shame unto my house,
  Curse to my honour. Where's Antonio?
  Thou traitress to my hate, what, is he shipp'd
  For England now? well, whimpering harlot, hence!

  _Mel._ Good father!

  _Pier._ Good me no goods. Seest thou that sprightly youth?
  Ere thou canst term to-morrow morning old,
  Thou shalt call him thy husband, lord, and love.

  _Mel._ Ay me!                                                   250

  _Pier._ Blirt on your "ay me's!" guard her safely hence.
  Drag her away, I'll be your guard to-night.
  Young prince, mount up your spirits and prepare
  To solemnise your nuptial's eve with pomp.

  _Gal._ The time is scant: now nimble wits appear:
  Phoebus begins to[156] gleam, the welkin's clear.

                            [_Exeunt all but_ BALURDO _and his_ Page.

  _Bal._ Now nimble wits appear! I'll myself appear,
  Balurdo's self, that in quick wit doth surpass,
  Will show the substance of a complete----.

  _Dil._ Ass, ass.

  _Bal._ I'll mount my courser, and most gallantly prick----.     260

  _Dil._ Gallantly prick is too long, and stands hardly in
  the verse, sir.

  _Bal._ I'll speak pure rhyme, and will so bravely prank
  it, that I'll toss love like a--prank, prank it!--a rhyme
  for prank it?

  _Dil._ Blanket.

  _Bal._ That I'll toss love, like a dog in a blanket. Hah
  hah, indeed, law. I think, hah hah; I think, hah hah,
  I think I shall tickle the Muses. And I strike it not
  dead, say, Balurdo, thou art an arrant sot.                     270

  _Dil._ Balurdo, thou art an arrant sot.

  _Enter_ ANDRUGIO _and_ ANTONIO _wreathed together_, LUCIO.

  _And._ Now, come, united force of chap-fall'n death;
  Come, power of fretting anguish, leave distress.
  O, thus enfolded, we have breasts of proof
  'Gainst all the venom'd stings of misery.

  _Ant._ Father, now I have an antidote
  'Gainst all the poison that the world can breathe:
  My Mellida, my Mellida doth bless
  This bleak waste with her presence.--How now, boy,
  Why dost thou weep? alas! where's Mellida?                      280

  _Page._[157] Ay me, my Lord.

  _Ant._[158] A sudden horror doth invade my blood;
  My sinews tremble, and my panting heart
  Scuds round about my bosom, to go out,
  Dreading the assailant, horrid passion.
  O, be no tyrant, kill me with one blow;
  Speak quickly, briefly, boy.

  _Page._ Her father found, and seized her; she is gone.

  _And._ Son, heat thy blood, be not froze up with grief
  Courage, sweet boy, sink not beneath the weight                 290
  Of crushing mischief. O where's thy dauntless heart,
  Thy father's spirit! I renounce thy blood,
  If thou forsake thy valour.

  _Lu._ See how his grief speaks in his slow-paced steps.
  Alas!
  'Tis more than he can utter, let him go:
  Dumb solitary path best suiteth woe.                [_Exit_ ANTONIO.

  _And._ Give me my arms, my armour, Lucio.

  _Lu._ Dear lord, what means this rage? when lacking use[159]
  Scarce safe's your life, will you in armour rise?               300

  _And._ Fortune fears valour, presseth cowardice.

  _Lu._ Then valour gets applause, when it hath place,
  And means to blaze it.

  _And. Nunquam potest non esse._

  _Lu._ Patience, my lord, may bring your ills some end.

  _And._ What patience, friend, can ruin'd hopes attend?
  Come, let me die like old Andrugio,
  Worthy my birth. O, blood-true-honour'd graves
  Are far more bless�d than base life of slaves.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [136] A correspondent of _Notes and Queries_ (1st ser., vol.
     ix. p. 513) points out that Erasmus has the same simile:--"Anima
     qu� moderatur utrumque corpus animantis improprie dicitur anima
     cum revera sint anim� reliqui�, non aliter quam odor rosarum
     manet in manu etiam rosa sublata."--_Colloq._, Leyden ed.,
     i. 694.

     [137] Old ed. "Holds."

     [138] These ravings are unintelligible.

     [139] The stage-direction in the old eds. is "_Enter Andrugio,
     Lucio, Cole, and Norwood._" I suppose that Cole and Norwood
     are the names of the actors who personated Andrugio and Lucio.

     [140] "Give me assay" = taste it before I drink. The
     _assayer_ in courts and baronial halls was the officer who
     tasted the dishes before the banquet in order to make sure that
     no poison was concealed.

     [141] Old eds. "_made open_ the glibbery ice," which modern
     editors absurdly retain. The word "glibbery" has been already
     noticed (note 3, p. 22).

     [142] Cf. _Julius C�sar_, i. 2 (text of First Folio):--"And then
     he offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by, and
     still as hee refus'd it the rabblement _howted_ and clapp'd their
     chopt hands." In that passage the first three folios give
     _howted_ and the fourth _houted_; but modern editors reject the
     word and read either _hooted_ or _shouted_. The present passage
     of Marston affords strong warrant for restoring the reading of
     the folios. _Hout_ is clearly an onomatopoeic word, like
     _hoit_:--He sings and _hoits_ and revels among his drunken
     companions," (_Knight of the Burning Pestle_).

     [143] Old eds. "last" (and so modern editors).

     [144] Old eds. "_misereri_."

     [145] Antonio is concealed behind a bush.

     [146] So ed. 1633.--Ed. 1602 "on."

     [147] Old eds. "_suamisce_."--Dilke reads "_smarisce_."

     [148] Old eds. "_Murono_."

     [149] Old eds. "_pol._"

     [150] So Dilke. Old eds. "_Bassiammi_."

     [151] Old eds. "_Che in sua neggia in quello_," &c.

     [152] Old eds. repeat the word "kissing."

     [153] "In good sadness" = seriously.

     [154] "Tweer" (or "twire") = peep, pry.

     [155] "The 'Dun Cow' is, we all know, intimately connected with
     the celebrated Guy, Earl of Warwick, and I believe his 'kettle'
     is one of the pretended relics still shown there. From the text I
     conjecture that the dun cow with the kettle on her head was in
     the time of Marston a well-known sign."--_Dilke._

     [156] Omitted in ed. 1602.

     [157] Old eds. "_Ant._"

     [158] Old eds. "_And._"

     [159] It is hard for Andrugio to escape detection even when he is
     unarmed; but if he puts on his armour he will be at once
     recognised. Cf. p. 46:--
                    "If you are but seen,
          Your arms display you; therefore put them off."




                              ACT V.


                             SCENE I.

                  _Palace of the Duke of Venice._

   _Enter_ BALURDO, _a_ Painter _with two pictures_, _and_ DILDO.

  _Bal._ And are you a painter? sir, can you draw, can
  you draw?

  _Pa._ Yes, sir.

  _Bal._ Indeed, law! now so can my father's forehorse.
  And are these the workmanship of your hands?

  _Pa._ I did limn them.

  _Bal._ Limn them? a good word, limn them: whose
  picture is this? _Anno Domini_, 1599. Believe me,
  master Anno Domini was of a good settled age when
  you limn'd him: 1599 years old! Let's see the other.
  _�tatis su�_ 24. Byrlady, he is somewhat younger.
  Belike master _�tatis su�_ was _Anno Domini's_ son.              12

  _Pa._ Is not your master a----

  _Dil._ He hath a little proclivity to him.

  _Pa._ Proclivity, good youth? I thank you for your
  courtly proclivity.

  _Bal._ Approach, good sir. I did send for you to draw
  me a device, an Imprezza, by _Synecdoche a Mott_. By
  Phoebus' crimson taffeta mantle, I think I speak as
  melodiously,--look you, sir, how think you on't? I
  would have you paint me, for my device, a good fat leg
  of ewe mutton, swimming in stewed broth of plums
  (boy, keel[160] your mouth, it runs over) and the word[161] shall
  be, _Hold my dish, whilst I spill my pottage_. Sure, in my
  conscience, 'twould be the most sweet device, now.               25

  _Pa._ 'Twould scent of kitchen-stuff too much.

  _Bal._ God's neaks, now I remember me, I ha' the
  rarest device in my head that ever breathed. Can you
  paint me a driveling reeling song, and let the word be,
  Uh.                                                              30

  _Pa._ A belch?

  _Bal._ O, no no: Uh, paint me Uh, or nothing.

  _Pa._ It cannot be done, sir, but by a seeming kind of
  drunkenness.

  _Bal._ No? well, let me have a good massy ring, with
  your own posy graven in it, that must sing a small treble,
  word for word, thus:

          _And if you will[162] my true lover be,
           Come follow me to the green wood._

  _Pa._ O Lord, sir, I cannot make a picture sing.                 40

  _Bal._ Why? 'slid, I have seen painted things sing as sweet;
  But I have't will tickle it for a conceit, i'faith.

                  _Enter_ FELICHE _and_ ALBERTO.

  _Alb._ O dear Feliche, give me thy device.
  How shall I purchase love of Rossaline?

  _Feli._ 'Swill, flatter her soundly.

  _Alb._ Her love is such, I cannot flatter her:
  But with my utmost vehemence of speech,
  I have ador'd her beauties.

  _Feli._ Hast writ good moving unaffected rhymes to her?

  _Alb._ O, yes, Feliche, but she scorns my writ.                  50

  _Feli._ Hast thou presented her with sumptuous gifts?

  _Alb._ Alas, my fortunes are too weak to offer them.

  _Feli._ O, then I have it, I'll tell thee what to do.

  _Alb._ What, good Feliche?

  _Feli._ Go and hang thyself; I say, go hang thyself,
  If that thou canst not give, go hang thyself:
  I'll rhyme thee dead, or verse thee to the rope.
  How think'st thou of a poet that sung thus?
  _Munera sola pacant, sola addunt munera formam:
  Munere sollicites Pallada, Cypris erit._                         60
  _Munera, munera!_

  _Alb._ I'll go and breathe my woes unto the rocks,
  And spend my grief upon the deafest seas.
  I'll weep my passion to the senseless trees,
  And load most solitary air with plaints.
  For woods, trees, sea, or rocky Apennine,
  Is not so ruthless as my Rossaline.
  Farewell, dear friend, expect no more of me:
  Here ends my part in this love's comedy.                         69

                                     [_Exeunt_ ALBERTO _and_ Painter.

  _Feli._ Now, master Balurdo, whither are you going, ha?

  _Bal._ Signior Feliche, how do you, faith? and by my
  troth, how do you?

  _Feli._ Whither art thou going, bully?[163]

  _Bal._ And as heaven help me, how do you?
  How, do you, i'faith, hee?

  _Feli._ Whither art going, man?

  _Bal._ O God, to the court; I'll be willing to give you
  grace and good countenance, if I may but see you in the
  presence.

  _Feli._ O, to court? farewell.                                   80

  _Bal._ If you see one in a yellow taffeta doublet, cut
  upon carnation velure,[164] a green hat, a blue pair of
  velvet hose, a gilt rapier, and an orange-tawny pair of
  worsted silk stockings, that's I, that's I.

  _Feli._ Very good: farewell.

  _Bal._ Ho, you shall know me as easily; I ha' bought
  me a new green feather with a red sprig; you shall see
  my wrought[165] shirt hang out at my breeches; you shall
  know me.                                                         89

  _Feli._ Very good, very good, farewell.

  _Bal._ Marry, in the mask 'twill be somewhat hard.
  But if you hear anybody speak so wittily, that he makes
  all the room laugh; that's I, that's I. Farewell, good
  Signior.

     _Enter_ FOROBOSCO, CASTILIO, _a Boy carrying a gilt harp_;
          PIERO, MELLIDA, _in night apparel_; ROSSALINE,
                       FLAVIA, _two Pages_.

  _Pier._ Advance the music's prize; now, cap'ring wits,
  Rise to your highest mount; let choice delight
  Garland the brow of this triumphant night.
  'Sfoot, 'a sits like Lucifer himself.

  _Ros._ Good sweet Duke,
  First let their voices strain for music's prize.[166]
  Give me the golden harp:                                                         100
  Faith, with your favour, I'll be umperess.

  _Pier._ Sweet niece, content: boys, clear your voice and
  sing.

                      _First[167] Boy sings._

  _Ros._ By this gold, I had rather have a servant with a
  short nose, and a thin hair, than have such a high-stretch'd
  minikin[168] voice.

  _Pier._ Fair niece, your reason?

  _Ros._ By the sweet of love, I should fear extremely
  that he were an eunuch.

  _Cast._ Spark spirit, how like you his voice?

  _Ros._ Spark spirit, how like you his voice!                    110
  So help me, youth, thy voice squeaks like a dry corkshoe:[169]
  come, come; let's hear the next.

                        _Second Boy sings._

  _Pier._ Trust me, a strong mean. Well sung, my boy.

                         _Enter_ BALRUDO.

  _Bal._ Hold, hold, hold: are ye blind? could ye not
  see my voice coming for the harp? And I knock not
  division[170] on the head, take hence the harp, make me
  a slip,[171] and let me go but for ninepence. Sir Mark,
  strike up for master Balurdo.

                        _Third Boy sings._

  Judgment, gentlemen, judgment! Was't not above line?
  I appeal to your mouths that heard my song.                     120
  Do[172] me right, and dub me knight, Balurdo.

  _Ros._ Kneel down, and I'll dub thee knight of the
  golden harp.

  _Bal._ Indeed, law, do, and I'll make you lady of the
  silver fiddlestick.

  _Ros._ Come, kneel, kneel.

                    _Enter a Page to_ BALURDO.

  _Bal._ My troth, I thank you, it hath never a whistle
  in't.

  _Ros._ Nay, good sweet coz, raise up your drooping
  eyes; and I were at the point of _To have and to hold
  from this day forward_, I would be asham'd to look thus
  lumpish. What, my pretty coz, 'tis but the loss of an
  odd maidenhead.                                                 133
  Shall's dance? thou art so sad, hark in thine[173] ear:
  I was about to say, but I'll forbear.

  _Bal._ I come, I come; more than most honeysuckle
  sweet ladies, pine not for my presence, I'll return in
  pomp. Well spoke, Sir Jeffrey Balurdo. As I am a
  true knight, I feel honourable eloquence begin to grope
  me already.                                            [_Exit._ 140

  _Pier._ Faith, mad niece, I wonder when thou wilt
  marry?

  _Ros._ Faith, kind uncle, when men abandon jealousy,
  forsake taking of tobacco, and cease to wear their beards
  so rudely long. O, to have a husband with a mouth
  continually smoking, with a bush of furze on the ridge
  of his chin, ready still to flop into his foaming chaps;
  ah, 'tis more than most intolerable.

  _Pier._ Nay faith, sweet niece, I was mighty strong in
  thought we should have shut up night with an old
  comedy: the Prince of Florence[174] shall have Mellida,
  and thou should'st have----.                                    152

  _Ros._ Nobody, good sweet uncle. I tell you, sir, I
  have thirty-nine servants, and my monkey that makes
  the fortieth. Now I love all of them lightly for something,
  but affect none of them seriously for anything.
  One's a passionate fool, and he flatters me above belief;
  the second's a testy ape, and he rails at me beyond
  reason; the third's as grave as some censor, and he
  strokes up his mustachios three times, and makes six
  plots of set faces, before he speaks one wise word; the
  fourth's as dry as the bur of an hartichoke; the fifth
  paints, and hath always a good colour for what he
  speaks; the sixth----.             164

  _Pier._ Stay, stay, sweet niece, what makes you thus
  suspect your gallants' worth?

  _Ros._ O, when I see one wear a periwig, I dread his
  hair; another wallow in a great slop,[175] I mistrust the
  proportion of his thigh; and wears a ruffled boot,[176] I fear
  the fashion of his leg. Thus, something in each thing, one
  trick in everything makes me mistrust imperfection in all
  parts; and there's the full point of my addiction.              172

      _The cornets sound a senet. Enter_ GALEATZO, MATZAGENTE,
                    _and_ BALURDO _in maskery_.

  _Pier._ The room's too scant: boys, stand in there, close.

  _Mel._ [_To_ GALEATZO.] In faith, fair sir, I am too sad to dance.

  _Pier._ How's that, how's that? too sad? By heaven, dance,
  And grace him too, or go to----, I say no more.

  _Mel._ A burning glass, the word[177] _splendente Phoebo_?
  It is too curious, I conceit it not.

  _Gal._ Faith, I'll tell thee. I'll no longer burn,
  Than you will shine and smile upon my love.                     180
  For look ye, fairest, by your pure sweets,
  I do not dote upon your excellence;
  And faith, unless you shed your brightest beams
  Of sunny favour and acceptive grace
  Upon my tender love, I do not burn:
  Marry, but shine, and I'll reflect your beams
  With fervent ardour. Faith! I would be loath to flatter
  thee, fair soul, because I love, not dote, court like thy
  husband, which thy father swears to-morrow morn I
  must be. This is all; and now from henceforth, trust
  me, Mellida, I'll not speak one wise word to thee more.

  _Mel._ I trust ye.                                              192

  _Gal._ By my troth, I'll speak pure fool[178] to thee
  now.

  _Mel._ You will speak the liker yourself.

  _Gal._ Good faith, I'll accept of the coxcomb, so you
  will not refuse the bable.[179]

  _Mel._ Nay, good sweet, keep them both; I am enamoured
  of neither.

  _Gal._ Go to, I must take you down for this. Lend
  me your ear.                                                    200

  _Ros._ A glow-worm? the word,--_Splendescit tant�m
  tenebris_.

  _Mat._ O, lady, the glow-worm figurates my valour,
  which shineth brightest in most dark, dismal, and horrid
  achievements.

  _Ros._ Or rather, your glow-worm represents your wit,
  which only seems to have fire in it, though indeed 'tis
  but an _ignis fatuus_, and shines only in the dark dead
  night of fools' admiration.

  _Mat._ Lady, my wit hath spurs, if it were dispos'd to
  ride you.                                                       211

  _Ros._ Faith, sir, your wit's spurs have but walking
  rowels; dull, blunt, they will not draw blood: the
  gentlemen-ushers may admit them the presence, for any
  wrong they can do to ladies.

  _Bal._ Truly, I have strained a note above ela[180] for a
  device: look you, 'tis a fair-ruled singing book; the
  word, _Perfect, if it were prick'd_.

  _Fla._ Though you are mask'd, I can guess who you
  are by your wit. You are not the exquisite Balurdo,
  the most rarely-shaped Balurdo.                                 221

  _Bal._ Who, I? No, I am not Sir Jeffrey Balurdo. I
  am not as well known by my wit as an alehouse by a
  red lattice.[181] I am not worthy to love and be beloved
  of Flavia.

  _Fla._ I will not scorn to favour such good parts
  As are applauded in your rarest self.       227

  _Bal._ Truly, you speak wisely, and like a jantlewoman
  of fourteen years of age. You know the stone called
  _lapis_; the nearer it comes to the fire, the hotter it is:
  and the bird, which the geometricians call _avis_, the
  farther it is from the earth, the nearer it is to the
  heaven; and love, the nigher it is to the flame, the
  more remote (there's a word, remote!) the more remote
  it is from the frost. Your wit is quick; a little thing
  pleaseth a young lady, and a small favour contenteth
  an old courtier; and so, sweet mistress, I truss my
  codpiece point.                                                 238

                         _Enter_ FELICHE.

  _Pier._ What might import this flourish? Bring us word.

  _Feli._ Stand away: here's such a company of flyboats,[182]
  hulling[183] about this galleasse[184] of greatness, that there's
  no boarding him.
  Do you hear, yon thing call'd duke?

  _Pier._ How now, blunt Feliche; what's the news?

  _Feli._ Yonder's a knight, hath brought Andrugio's head,
  And craves admittance to your chair of state.

        _Cornets sound a senet. Enter_ ANDRUGIO _in armour_.

  _Pier._ Conduct him with attendance sumptuous;
  Sound all the pleasing instruments of joy;
  Make triumph stand on tiptoe whilst we meet:
  O sight most gracious, O revenge most sweet!                    250

  _And. We vow, by the honour of our birth, to recompense
  any man that bringeth Andrugio's head, with twenty thousand
  double pistolets, and the endearing to our choicest
  love._

  _Pier._ We still with most unmoved resolve[185] confirm
  Our large munificence, and here breathe
  A sad and solemn protestation:
  When I recall this vow, O, let our house
  Be even commanded, stain'd, and trampled on,
  As worthless rubbish of nobility.                               260

  _And._ Then here [_raising his beaver_], Piero, is Andrugio's head,

  Royally casqu�d in a helm of steel:
  Give me thy love, and take it. My dauntless soul
  Hath that unbounded vigour in his spirits
  That it can bear more rank indignity,
  With less impatience than thy canker'd hate
  Can sting and venom his untainted worth
  With the most vip'rous sound of malice. Strike!
  O, let no glimpse of honour light thy thoughts;
  If there be any heat of royal breath                            270
  Creeping in thy veins, O stifle it;
  Be still thyself, bloody and treacherous.
  Fame not thy house with an admir�d act
  Of princely pity. Piero, I am come
  To soil thy house with an eternal blot
  Of savage cruelty; strike, or bid me strike.
  I pray my death; that thy ne'er-dying shame
  Might live immortal to posterity.
  Come, be a princely hangman, stop my breath.
  O dread thou shame, no more than I dread death.                 280

  _Pier._ We are amazed, our royal spirit's numb'd
  In stiff astonish'd wonder at thy prowess.
  Most mighty, valiant, and high-tow'ring heart,
  We blush, and turn our hate upon ourselves,
  For hating such an unpeer'd excellence.
  I joy my state: him whom I loath'd before,
  That now I honour, love, nay more, adore.

                   [_The still flutes sound a mournful senet. Enter a
                         funeral procession, followed by_ LUCIO.

  But stay; what tragic spectacle appears!
  Whose body bear you in that mournful hearse?

  _Lu._ The breathless trunk of young Antonio.                    290

  _Mel._ Antonio! ay me! my lord, my love! my----.

  _And._ Sweet precious issue of most honour'd blood,
  Rich hope, ripe virtue, O untimely loss!
  Come hither, friend: prithee, do not weep.
  Why, I am glad he's dead; he shall not see
  His father's vanquish'd by his enemy,
  Even in princely honour. Nay, prithee, speak!
  How died the wretched boy?

  _Lu._ My lord!

  _And._ I hope he died yet like my son, i'faith.                 300

  _Lu._ Alas, my lord!

  _And._ He died unforced, I trust, and valiantly?

  _Lu._ Poor gentleman, being----

  _And._ Did his hand shake, or his eye look dull,
  His thoughts reel fearful when he struck the stroke?
  And if they did, I'll rend them out the hearse,
  Rip up his cerecloth, mangle his bleak face,
  That when he comes to heaven, the powers divine,
  Shall ne'er take notice that he was my son:
  I'll quite disclaim his birth. Nay, prithee, speak!             310
  And 'twere not hooped with steel, my breast would break.

  _Mel._ O that my spirit in a sigh could mount
  Into the sphere where thy sweet soul doth rest!

  _Pier._ O that my tears, bedewing thy wan cheek,
  Could make new spirit sprout in thy cold blood!

  _Bal._ Verily, he looks as pitifully as a poor John;[186]
  as I am true knight, I could weep like a ston'd
  horse.

  _And._ Villain, 'tis thou hast murder�d my son!
  Thy unrelenting spirit, thou black dog,      320
  That took'st no passion[187] of his fatal love,
  Hath forced him give his life untimely end.

  _Pier._ O! that my life, her love, my dearest blood,
  Would but redeem one minute of his breath!

  _Ant._ [_rising_.] I seize that breath. Stand not amazed,
     great states;
  I rise from death that never lived till now.
  Piero, keep thy vow, and I enjoy
  More unexpress�d height of happiness
  Than power of thought can reach; if not, lo, here
  There stands my tomb, and here a pleasing stage.                330
  Most-wish'd spectators of my tragedy,
  To this end have I feign'd, that her fair eye,
  For whom I lived, might bless me ere I die.

  _Mel._ Can breath depaint[188] my unconceiv�d thoughts?
  Can words describe my infinite delight
  Of seeing thee, my lord Antonio?
  O no; conceit, breath, passion, words, be dumb,
  Whilst I instill the dew of my sweet bliss,
  In the soft pressure of a melting kiss!
  _Sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras._                                340

  _Pier._ Fair son (now I'll be proud to call thee son),
  Enjoy me thus: my very breast is thine;
  Possess me freely, I am wholly thine.

  _Ant._ Dear father----

  _And._ Sweet son, sweet son, I can speak no more:
  My joy's passion flows above the shore,
  And chokes the current of my speech.

  _Pier._ Young Florence prince, to you my lips must beg
  For a remittance of your interest.

  _Gal._ In your fair daughter? with all my thought.              350
  So help me faith, the nak'd truth I'll unfold;
  He that was never[189] hot will soon be cold.

  _Pier._ No man else makes claim unto her?

  _Mat._ The valiant speak truth in brief: no--

  _Bal._ Truly, for Sir Jeffrey Balurdo, he disclaims to
  have had anything in her.

  _Pier._ Then here I give her to Antonio.
  Royal, valiant, most respected prince,
  Let's clip our hands, I'll thus observe my vow:
  I promised twenty thousand double pistolets,                    360
  With the endearing to my dearest love,
  To him that brought thy head; thine be the gold,
  To solemnise our houses' unity;
  My love be thine, the all I have, be thine.
  Fill us fresh wine, the form we'll take by this;
  We'll drink a health, while they two sip a kiss.[190]
  Now there remains no discord that can sound
  Harsh accents to the ear of our accord:
  So please you,[191] niece, to match.                            369


  _Ros._ Troth, uncle, when my sweet-faced coz hath told
  me how she likes the thing called wedlock, may be I'll
  take a survey of the checkroll of my servants; and he
  that hath the best parts of--I'll prick him down for my
  husband.

  _Bal._ For passion of love now, remember me to my
  mistress, lady Rossaline, when she is pricking down the
  good parts of her servants. As I am true knight, I grow
  stiff; I shall carry it.

  _Pier._ I will.
  Sound Lydian wires, once make a pleasing note                   380
  On nectar streams of your sweet airs to float.

  _Ant._ Here ends the comic crosses of true love;
  O! may the passage most successful prove!

_And._ Gentlemen, though I remain an armed Epilogue,[192]
I stand not as a peremptory challenger of desert, either
for him that composed the Comedy, or for us that acted
it; but a most submissive suppliant for both. What
imperfection you have seen in us, leave with us, and
we'll amend it; what hath pleased you, take with you,
and cherish it. You shall not be more ready to embrace
anything commendable, than we will endeavour to amend
all things reprovable. What we are, is by your favour.
What we shall be, rests all in your applausive encouragements.

Title: ANTONIO'S REVENGE.

                _THE SECOND PART OF THE HISTORY OF
                       ANTONIO AND MELLIDA._




_Antonios Reuenge. The second part. As it hath beene sundry times
acted, by the children of Paules. Written by I. M. London. Printed for
Thomas Fisher, and are to be soulde in Saint Dunstans Church-yarde._
1602. 4to.


                        STORY OF THE PLAY.

Piero had been a suitor for the hand of Maria, daughter of the Duke of
Ferrara, but his addresses had been rejected and Maria had married
Andrugio, the offspring of the union being Antonio. When Piero,
dissembling his hatred, affects to be reconciled to Andrugio, Lucio is
despatched to bring Maria to the Venetian Court. Piero, at a banquet
given on the eve of his daughter's marriage with Antonio, instils in
Andrugio's cup a poison which has no immediate effect but works
fatally after a few hours. With the help of a base creature, Strotzo,
he proceeds in the night to murder Antonio's friend, Feliche, whose
body is carried by Strotzo to Mellida's chamber. At sunrise Maria and
Lucio arrive at Venice. Antonio, whose sleep has been troubled by
hideous dreams, is abroad early, and is met by his mother as he paces
disquietly in front of Mellida's chamber. Presently the window-curtain
is drawn aside and there is exposed the body of Feliche, stabbed thick
with wounds. While Antonio is distractedly calling upon Mellida to
rise, Piero advances and proclaims himself the author of Feliche's
death, protesting that he had found his daughter in the embraces of
the murdered man. The scene of confusion is heightened by the entrance
of Strotzo, who announces that Andrugio has died from excess of joy at
his sudden change of fortunes. Mellida is put in close confinement,
and a day is appointed for her trial. Strotzo is instructed by Piero
to come forward at the trial and accuse Antonio of having instigated
the murders of Andrugio and Feliche. But before the trial Andrugio's
ghost appears to Antonio, discloses Piero's villainy, and bids Antonio
take vengeance on the murderer. Antonio stabs Piero's young son Julio
at Andrugio's shrine; he then disguises himself as Maria's fool and
watches his opportunity for further vengeance. The trial of Mellida is
held: Strotzo enters the court with a cord round his neck, declaring
that he had been suborned by Antonio to commit the crimes; and
officers are despatched to arrest Antonio, who in his fool's habit is
watching the proceedings. It had been part of the plot that Strotzo,
after making his confession, should break into passionate outbursts of
sorrow and implore Piero to rid him of a dishonourable life; whereupon
Piero was to spring forward, grasp the cord round Strotzo's neck as
with intent to strangle him, then suddenly to relax his hold, moved by
Strotzo's penitent conduct. Strotzo goes through his part of the
performance; but Piero, grasping one end of the cord while Castilio (a
courtier) grasps the other, is careful not to loose his hold before
the victim is strangled. Presently word is brought that Antonio in a
fit of distraction has flung himself from a high tower into the sea.
At this news Mellida falls into a deep swoon and is conveyed to her
chamber, whither Antonio after a short delay contrives to follow her,
but arrives only in time to see her expire. Piero, notwithstanding his
daughter's untoward death, determines that his marriage with Maria
(who affects to acquiesce in the arrangement) shall take place without
delay. A scheme of vengeance is contrived between Antonio, Pandulfo
(Feliche's father) and Alberto (Feliche's friend). The conspirators
attire themselves as maskers and appear at a banquet given by Piero on
the eve of his marriage. On the appearance of the maskers Piero
enquires for his son, Julio, and sends an attendant to fetch him to
see the dances. After dancing a measure the maskers request Piero to
have the hall cleared while they sit unmasked at the banquet.
Thereupon the guests and retainers withdraw, but Piero at the maskers'
request remains. He takes a seat at the banquet; the conspirators,
unmasking themselves, spring forward and bind him with cords to the
chair; insult over him, cut out his tongue, produce in a dish the
limbs of his murdered son, and finally hack him to death with their
swords. The tyrant's death is welcomed with universal joy. The
conspirators are hailed as saviours of their country, and are offered
high offices of state; but prefer to spend the rest of their lives in
the seclusion of a religious house.




                           THE PROLOGUE.



  The rawish dank of clumsy[193] winter ramps
  The fluent summer's vein; and drizzling sleet
  Chilleth the wan bleak cheek of the numb'd earth,
  Whilst snarling gusts nibble the juiceless leaves
  From the nak'd shudd'ring branch; and pills[194] the skin
  From off the soft and delicate aspects.
  O now, methinks, a sullen tragic scene
  Would suit the time with pleasing congruence.
  May we be happy in our weak devoir,
  And all part pleas�d in most wish'd content!                     10
  But sweat of Hercules can ne'er beget
  So blest an issue. Therefore, we proclaim,
  If any spirit breathes within this round,
  Uncapable of weighty passion,
  (As from his birth being hugg�d in the arms,
  And nuzzled 'twixt the breasts of happiness)
  Who winks, and shuts his apprehension up
  From common sense of what men were and are,
  Who would not know what men must be--let such
  Hurry amain from our black-visaged shows:                        20
  We shall affright their eyes. But if a breast
  Nail'd to the earth with grief; if any heart
  Pierc'd through with anguish pant within this ring;
  If there be any blood whose heat is choked
  And stifled with true sense of misery;
  If ought of these strains fill this consort up--
  Th' arrive most welcome. O that our power
  Could lackey or keep wing with our desires,
  That with unus�d paize[195] of style and sense,
  We might weigh massy in judicious scale.      30
  Yet here's the prop that doth support our hopes:
  When our scenes falter, or invention halts,
  Your favour will give crutches to our faults.[196]         [_Exit._

                              ACT I.


                             SCENE I.

               _A corridor in the palace of_ PIERO.

     _Enter_ PIERO, _unbraced, his arms bare, smeared in blood,
      a poniard in one hand bloody, and a torch in the other_;
                STROTZO _following him with a cord_.

  _Pier._ Ho, Gasper Strotzo, bind Feliche's trunk
  Unto the panting side of Mellida!

                                                     [_Exit_ STROTZO.

  'Tis yet dead night, yet all the earth is clutch'd[198]
  In the dull leaden hand of snoring sleep;
  No breath disturbs the quiet of the air,
  No spirit moves upon the breast of earth,
  Save howling dogs, night-crows, and screeching owls,
  Save meagre ghosts, Piero, and black thoughts.
  One, two!

                                                    [_Clock strikes._

  Lord, in two hours what a topless mount                          10
  Of unpeer'd mischief have these hands cast up!

                        _Re-enter_ STROTZO.

  I can scarce coop triumphing vengeance up
  From bursting forth in braggart passion.

  _Str._ My lord, 'tis firmly said that----

  _Pier._ Andrugio sleeps in peace: this brain hath choked
  The organ of his breast. Feliche hangs
  But as a bait upon the line of death,
  To tice on mischief. I am great in blood,
  Unequall'd in revenge. You horrid scouts
  That sentinel swart night, give loud applause                    20
  From your large palms. First, know, my heart was rais'd
  Unto Andrugio's life upon this ground--

  _Str._ Duke, 'tis reported----

  _Pier._ We both were rivals in our may of blood,
  Unto Maria, fair Ferrara's heir.
  He won the lady, to my honour's death,
  And from her sweets cropp'd this Antonio;
  For which I burnt in inward swelt'ring hate,
  And fester'd rankling malice in my breast,
  Till I might belk revenge upon his eyes:                         30
  And now (O bless�d now!) 'tis done. Hell, night,
  Give loud applause to my hypocrisy.
  When his bright valour even dazzled sense,
  In off'ring his own head, public reproach
  Had blurr'd my name. Speak, Strotzo, had it not?
  If then I had----

  _Str._ It had, so please----

  _Pier._ What had, so please? Unseasoned sycophant,
  Piero Sforza is no numb�d lord,
  Senseless of all true touch;[199] stroke not the head            40
  Of infant speech, till it be fully born;
  Go to!

  _Str._ How now! Fut, I'll not smother your speech.

  _Pier._ Nay, right thine eyes: 'twas but a little spleen,--
  (Huge plunge![200]
  Sin's grown a slave, and must observe slight evils;
  Huge villains are enforced to claw[201] all devils.)--
  Pish, sweet, thy thoughts, and give me----.

  _Str._ Stroke not the head of infant speech! go to!

  _Pier._ Nay, calm this storm. I ever held thy breast
  More secret, and more firm in league of blood,                   50
  Than to be struck in heat with each slight puff.
  Give me thy ears; huge infamy [had] press['d] down
  My honour, if even then, when his fresh act
  Of prowess bloom'd out full,
  I had ta'en vengeance on his hated head----.

  _Str._ Why it had----.

  _Pier._ Could I avoid to give a seeming grant
  Unto fruition of Antonio's love?

  _Str._ No.

  _Pier._ And didst thou ever see a Judas kiss                     60
  With a more covert touch of fleering hate?

  _Str._ No.

  _Pier._ And having clipt them with pretence of love,
  Have I not crush'd them with a cruel wring?

  _Str._ Yes.

  _Pier._ Say, faith, didst thou e'er hear, or read, or see
  Such happy vengeance, unsuspected death?
  That I should drop strong poison in the bowl,
  Which I myself caroused unto his health
  And future fortune of our unity!                                 70
  That it should work even in the hush[202] of night,
  And strangle him on sudden, that fair show
  Of death, for the excessive joy of his fate,
  Might choke the murder! Ha, Strotzo, is't not rare?
  Nay, but weigh it. Then Feliche stabb'd
  (Whose sinking thought[203] frighted my conscious heart),
  And laid by Mellida, to stop the match,
  And hale on mischief. This all in one night!
  Is't to be equall'd, think'st thou? O, I could eat
  Thy fumbling throat, for thy lagg'd censure. Fut,                80
  Is't not rare?

  _Str._ Yes.

  _Pier._ No? yes? nothing but _no_ and _yes_, dull lump?
  Canst thou not honey me with fluent speech,
  And even adore my topless villainy?
  Will I not blast my own blood for revenge,
  Must not thou straight be perjur'd for revenge,
  And yet no creature dream 'tis my revenge?
  Will I not turn a glorious bridal morn
  Unto a Stygian night? Yet naught but _no_ and _yes_!             90

  _Str._ I would have told you, if the incubus[204]
  That rides your bosom would have patience,
  It is reported that in private state
  Maria, Genoa's duchess, makes to court,
  Longing to see him, whom she ne'er shall see,
  Her lord Andrugio. Belike she hath receiv'd
  The news of reconciliation.
  A[205] reconciliation with death!
  Poor lady! shall but find poor comfort in't.

  _Pier._ O, let me swoon for joy. By heaven, I think             100
  I ha' said my prayers, within this month at least;
  I am so boundless happy. Doth she come?
  By this warm reeking gore, I'll marry her.
  Look I not now like an inamorate?[206]
  Poison the father, butcher the son, and marry the mother, ha!
  Strotzo, to bed: snort in securest sleep;
  For see, the dapple grey coursers of the morn
  Beat up the light with their bright silver hooves,
  And chase it through the sky.--To bed, to bed!
  This morn my vengeance shall be amply fed.           [_Exeunt._ 110


     [198] Old eds. "cloucht," which we might regard as a misprint for
     "coucht" if Marston had not shown an excessive fondness
     (ridiculed in _The Poetaster_) for the word "clutch."

     [199] Feeling, perception.--See Dyce's _Shakesp. Glossary_.

     [200] _Plunge_ often has the meaning of--difficulty,
     embarrassment. I suppose it has that meaning here. Piero is
     annoyed at having to speak fair words to so paltry a rascal as
     Strotzo.

     [201] Stroke gently, flatter.--A common name for a flatterer was
     _clawback._--"Flatant.--Flattering, fawning, colloguing with,
     _clawing_, smoothing, stroaking."--_Cotgrave._

     [202] Old eds. "husht."

     [203] "Sinking thought" is a curious expression. It means, I
     suppose--deep discernment, penetrative shrewdness. Piero dreaded
     that his villainies would be detected by Feliche.

     [204] Marston's use of this word is ridiculed in _The Poetaster_
     (v. 1).

     [205] Old eds. "Reconciliation with a death?" Metre and sense
     show that the article "a" has been misplaced by the printer.

     [206] So old eds.


                             SCENE II.

                _Precincts of the palace of_ PIERO.

               _Enter_ LUCIO, MARIA, _and_ NUTRICHE.

  _Mar._ Stay, gentle Lucio, and vouchsafe thy hand.

  _Lu._ O, Madam----.

  _Mar._ Nay, prithee give me leave to say, vouchsafe;
  Submiss entreats beseem my humble fate.
  Here let us sit. O Lucio, fortune's gilt
  Is rubb'd quite off from my slight tin-foil'd state,
  And poor Maria must appear ungraced
  Of the bright fulgor of gloss'd majesty.

  _Lu._ Cheer up your spirits, Madam; fairer chance,
  Than that which courts your presence instantly,                  10
  Can not be formed by the quick mould of thought.

  _Mar._ Art thou assured the dukes are reconciled?
  Shall my womb's honour wed fair Mellida?
  Will heaven at length grant harbour to my head?
  Shall I once more clip my Andrugio,
  And wreath my arms about Antonio's neck?
  Or is glib rumour grown a parasite,
  Holding a false glass to my sorrow's eyes,
  Making the wrinkled front of grief seem fair,
  Though 'tis much rivell'd[207] with abortive care?               20

  _Lu._ Most virtuous princess, banish straggling fear,
  Keep league with comfort. For these eyes beheld
  The dukes united; yon faint glimmering light
  Ne'er peep�d through the crannies of the east,
  Since I beheld them drink a sound carouse,
  In sparkling Bacchus, unto each other's health;
  Your son assur'd[208] to beauteous Mellida,
  And all clouds clear'd of threat'ning discontent.

  _Mar._ What age is morning of?

  _Lu._ I think 'bout five.

  _Mar._ Nutriche, Nutriche!                                       30

  _Nut._ Beshrow your fingers! marry, you have disturb'd
  the pleasure of the finest dream. O God! I was even
  coming to it, law. O Jesu! 'twas coming of the sweetest.
  I'll tell you now, methought I was married, and methought
  I spent (O Lord, why did you wake me?), and
  methought I spent three spur-royals[209] on the fiddlers for
  striking up a fresh hornpipe. Saint Ursula! I was even
  going to bed, and you, methought, my husband, was
  even putting out the tapers, when you--Lord I shall never
  have such a dream come upon me, as long as----.                  40

  _Mar._ Peace, idle creature, peace!--When will the
  court rise?

  _Lu._ Madam, 'twere best you took some lodging up,
  And lay in private till the soil of grief
  Were clear'd your cheek, and new burnish'd lustre
  Cloth�d your presence, 'fore you saw the dukes,
  And enter'd 'mong the proud Venetian states.[210]

  _Mar._ No, Lucio, my dear lord is wise, and knows
  That tinsel glitter, or rich purfled[211] robes,
  Curl'd hairs, hung full of sparkling carcanets,
  Are not the true adornments of a wife.                           50
  So long as wives are faithful, modest, chaste,
  Wise lords affect them. Virtue doth not waste
  With each slight flame of crackling vanity.
  A modest eye forceth affection,
  Whilst outward gayness' light looks but entice:
  Fairer than nature's fair is foulest vice.
  She that loves art to get her cheek more lovers,
  Much outward gauds, slight inward grace discovers.
  I care not to seem fair but to my lord:
  Those that strive most to please most strangers' sight,
  Folly may judge most fair, wisdom most light.                    61

                                      [_Music sounds a short strain._

  But hark, soft music gently moves the air!
  I think the bridegroom's up. Lucio, stand close.
  O now, Maria, challenge grief to stay
  Thy joy's encounter. Look, Lucio, 'tis clear day.

                             [_They retire to the back of the stage._

          _Enter_ ANTONIO, GALEATZO, MATZAGENTE, BALURDO,
         PANDULPHO, FELICHE, ALBERTO, FOROBOSCO, CASTILIO,
                           _and a Page_.

  _Ant._ Darkness is fled: look, infant morn hath drawn
  Bright silver curtains 'bout the couch of night;
  And now Aurora's horse trots azure rings,[212]
  Breathing fair light about the firmament.--
  Stand, what's that?                                                70

  _Mat._ And if a horn�d devil should burst forth,
  I would pass on him with a mortal stock.[213]

  _Alb._ Oh, a horned devil would prove ominous
  Unto a bridegroom's eyes.

  _Mat._ A horned devil? Good: ha, ha, ha!--very good!

  _Alb._ Good tann'd prince, laugh not. By the joys of love,
  When thou dost girn,[214] thy rusty face doth look
  Like the head of a roasted rabbit: fie upon't!

  _Bal._ By my troth, methinks his nose is just colour de roy.[215]

  _Mat._ I tell thee, fool, my nose will abide no jest.            80

  _Bal._ No, in truth, I do not jest; I speak truth. Truth
  is the touchstone of all things; and, if your nose will not
  abide the truth, your nose will not abide the touch; and,
  if your nose will not abide the touch, your nose is a
  copper nose, and must be nail'd up for a slip.[216]

  _Mat._ I scorn to retort the obtuse jest of a fool.

                 [BALURDO _draws out his writing tables, and writes_.

  _Bal._ Retort and obtuse, good words, very good words.

  _Gal._ Young prince, look sprightly; fie, a bridegroom sad!

  _Bal._ In truth, if he were retort and obtuse, no question
  he would be merry; but, and please my genius, I will be
  most retort and obtuse ere night. I'll tell you what I'll
  bear soon at night in my shield, for my device.                  92

  _Gal._ What, good Balurdo?

  _Bal._ O, do me right:--Sir Jeffrey Balurdo; sir, sir,
  as long as ye live, sir.

  _Gal._ What, good Sir Jeffrey Balurdo?

  _Bal._ Marry forsooth, I'll carry for my device my grandfather's
  great stone horse, flinging up his head, and
  jerking out his left leg: the word, "Wighy Purt." As I
  am a true knight, will't not be most retort and obtuse,
  ha?                                                             101

  _Ant._ Blow hence these sapless jests. I tell you, bloods,
  My spirit's heavy, and the juice of life
  Creeps slowly through my stiffen'd arteries.
  Last sleep, my sense was steep'd in horrid dreams:
  Three parts of night were swallow'd in the gulf
  Of ravenous time, when to my slumb'ring powers,
  Two meagre ghosts made apparition.
  The one's breast seem'd fresh paunch'd with bleeding wounds,
  Whose bubbling gore sprang in [my] frighted eyes;               110
  The other ghost assum'd my father's shape:
  Both cried, "Revenge!" At which my trembling joints,
  Ic�d quite over with a frozed cold sweat,[217]
  Leap'd forth the sheets. Three[218] times I g[r]asp'd at shades,
  And thrice, deluded by erroneous sense,
  I forc'd my thoughts make stand; when lo, I oped[219]
  A large bay window, th[o]rough which the night
  Struck terror to my soul. The verge of heaven
  Was ring'd with flames, and all the upper vault
  Thick-lac'd with flakes of fire; in midst whereof               120
  A blazing comet shot his threat'ning train
  Just on my face. Viewing these prodigies,
  I bow'd my naked knee and pierc'd the star
  With an outfacing eye, pronouncing thus:
  _Deus imperat astris_. At which, my nose straight bled;
  Then doubted I my word, so slunk to bed.                        126

  _Bal._ Verily, Sir Jeffrey had a monstrous strange dream
  the last night. For methought I dreamt I was asleep,
  and methought the ground yawn'd and belkt up the
  abhominable ghost of a misshapen simile, with two ugly
  pages; the one called master, even as going before; and
  the other mounser,[220] even so following after; whilst
  Signior Simile stalk'd most prodigiously in the midst.
  At which I bewray'd[221] the fearfulness of my nature, and
  being ready to forsake the fortress of my wit, start up,
  called for a clean shirt, ate a mess of broth, and with
  that I awaked.

  _Ant._ I prithee, peace. I tell you, gentlemen,
  The frightful shades of night yet shake my brain:
  My jellied[222] blood's not thaw'd: the sulphur damps,          140
  That flew[223] in wing�d lightning 'bout my couch,
  Yet stick within my sense, my soul is great
  In expectation of dire prodigies.

  _Pan._ Tut, my young prince, let not thy fortunes see
  Their lord a coward. He that's nobly born
  Abhors to fear: base fear's the brand of slaves.
  He that observes, pursues, slinks back for fright,
  Was never cast in mould of noble sprite.

  _Gal._ Tush, there's a sun will straight exhale these damps
  Of chilling fear. Come, shall's salute the bride?               150

  _Ant._ Castilio, I prithee mix thy breath with his:
  Sing one of Signior Renaldo's airs,
  To rouse the slumb'ring bride from gluttoning
  In surfeit of superfluous sleep. Good signior, sing.

                                                           [_A Song._

  What means this silence and unmov�d calm?
  Boy, wind thy cornet: force the leaden gates
  Of lazy sleep fly open with thy breath.
  My Mellida not up? not stirring yet? umh!

  _Mar._ That voice should be my son's, Antonio's.
  Antonio!                                                        160

  _Ant._ Here: who calls? here stands Antonio.

  _Mar._ Sweet son!

  _Ant._ Dear mother!

  _Mar._ Fair honour of a chaste and loyal bed,
  Thy father's beauty, thy sad mother's love,
  Were I as powerful as the voice of fate,
  Felicity complete should sweet thy state;
  But all the blessings that a poor banish'd wretch
  Can pour upon thy head, take, gentle son:
  Live, gracious youth, to close thy mother's eyes,               170
  Loved of thy parents, till their latest hour.
  How cheers my lord, thy father? O sweet boy,
  Part of him thus I clip, my dear, dear joy.

                                                  [_Embraces_ ANTONIO.

  _Ant._ Madam, last night I kissed his princely hand,
  And took a treasured blessing from his lips.
  O mother, you arrive in jubilee,
  And firm atonement of all boist'rous rage;
  Pleasure, united love, protested faith,
  Guard my loved father, as sworn pensioners:
  The dukes are leagued in firmest bond of love,                  180
  And you arrive even in the solsticy
  And highest point of sunshine happiness.

                                        [_One winds a cornet within._

  Hark, madam, how yon cornet jerketh up
  His strain'd shrill accents in the capering air,
  As proud to summon up my bright-cheek'd love!
  Now, mother, ope wide expectation;
  Let loose your amplest sense, to entertain
  Th' impression of an object of such worth
  That life's too poor to----

  _Gal._ Nay, leave hyperboles.

  _Ant._ I tell thee, prince, that presence straight appears
  Of which thou canst not form hyperboles;                        191
  The trophy of triumphing excellence,
  The heart of beauty, Mellida appears.
  See, look, the curtain stirs; shine nature's pride,
  Love's vital spirit, dear Antonio's bride.

            [_The curtain's drawn, and the body of_ FELICHE, _stabb'd
                thick with wounds, appears hung up_.

  What villain bloods the window of my love?
  What slave hath hung yon gory ensign up
  In flat defiance of humanity?
  Awake, thou fair unspotted purity!
  Death's at thy window, awake, bright Mellida!                   200
  Antonio calls!

            _Enter_ PIERO, _unbraced, with_ FOROBOSCO.

  _Pier._ Who gives these ill-befitting attributes
  Of chaste, unspotted, bright, to Mellida?
  He lies as loud as thunder: she's unchaste,
  Tainted, impure, black as the soul of hell.

           [ANTONIO _draws his rapier, offers to run at_ PIERO, _but_
               MARIA _holds his arm and stays him_.

  _Ant._ Dog! I will make thee eat thy vomit up,
  Which thou hast belkt 'gainst taintless Mellida.

  _Pier._[224] Ram't quickly down, that it may not rise up
  To imbraid[225] my thoughts. Behold my stomach;
  Strike me quite through with the relentless edge                210
  Of raging fury. Boy, I'll kill thy love.
  Pandulf Feliche, I have stabb'd thy son:
  Look, yet his lifeblood reeks upon this steel.
  Albert, yon hangs thy friend. Have none of you
  Courage of vengeance? Forget I am your duke;
  Think Mellida is not Piero's blood;
  Imagine on slight ground I'll blast his honour;
  Suppose I saw not that incestuous slave,
  Clipping the strumpet with luxurious twines![226]
  O, numb my sense of anguish, cast my life                       220
  In a dead sleep, whilst law cuts off yon maim,[227]
  Yon putrid ulcer of my royal blood!

  _For._ Keep league with reason, gracious sovereign.

  _Pier._ There glow no sparks of reason in the world;
  All are raked up in ashy beastliness.
  The bulk of man's as dark as Erebus,
  No branch of reason's light hangs in his trunk:
  There lives no reason to keep league withal.
  I ha' no reason to be reasonable.
  Her wedding eve, link'd to the noble blood                      230
  Of my most firmly-reconcil�d friend,
  And found even cling'd in sensuality!
  O heaven! O heaven! Were she as near my heart
  As is my liver, I would rend her off.

                          _Enter_ STROTZO.

  _Str._ Whither, O whither shall I hurl vast grief!

  _Pier._ Here, into my breast: 'tis a place built wide
  By fate, to give receipt to boundless woes.

  _Str._ O no; here throb those hearts, which I must cleave
  With my keen-piercing news. Andrugio's dead.

  _Pier._ Dead!                                                   240

  _Mar._ O me, most miserable!

  _Pier._ Dead! alas, how dead?             [_Gives seeming passion._
  [_Aside._] Fut, weep, act, feign--Dead! alas, how dead?

  _Str._ The vast delights of his large sudden joys
  Open'd his powers so wide, that 's native heat
  So prodigally flow'd t' exterior parts,
  That th'inner citadel was left unmann'd,
  And so surpris'd on sudden by cold death.

  _Mar._ O fatal, disastrous, curs�d, dismal!
  Choke breath and life! I breathe, I live too long.              250
  Andrugio, my lord, I come, I come!                       [_Swoons._

  _Pier._ Be cheerful, princess; help, Castilio,
  The lady's swoun�d;[228] help to bear her in:
  Slow comfort to huge cares is swiftest sin.

  _Bal._ Courage, courage, sweet lady, 'tis Sir Jeffrey
  Balurdo bids you courage. Truly I am as nimble as an
  elephant about a lady.

                           [_Exeunt_ PIERO, CASTILIO, FOROBOSCO _and_
                                        BALURDO, _bearing out_ MARIA.

  _Pan._ Dead!

  _Ant._ Dead!

  _Alb._ Dead!                                                    260

  _Ant._ Why, now the womb of mischief is deliver'd,
  Of the prodigious issue of the night.

  _Pan._ Ha, ha, ha!

  _Ant._ My father dead: my love attaint of lust,--
  That's a large lie, as vast as spacious hell!
  Poor guiltless lady! O, accurs�d lie!
  What, whom, whither, which shall I first lament?
  A[229] dead father, a dishonour'd wife? Stand.
  Methinks I feel the frame of nature shake.
  Cracks not the joints of earth to bear my woes?                 270

  _Alb._ Sweet prince, be patient.

  _Ant._ 'Slid, sir, I will not in despite of thee.
  Patience is slave to fools: a chain that's fixt
  Only to posts, and senseless log-like dolts.

  _Alb._ 'Tis reason's glory to command affects.[230]

  _Ant._ Lies thy cold father dead, his gloss�d eyes
  New clos�d up by thy sad mother's hands?
  Hast thou a love, as spotless as the brow
  Of clearest heaven, blurr'd with false defames?
  Are thy moist entrails crumpled up with grief                   280
  Of parching mischiefs? Tell me, does thy heart
  With punching anguish spur thy gall�d ribs?
  Then come, let's sit[231] and weep and wreathe our arms:
  I'll hear thy counsel.

  _Alb._ Take comfort.

  _Ant._ Confusion to all comfort! I defy it.
  Comfort's a parasite, a flattering jack,[232]
  And melts resolv'd despair. O boundless woe,
  If there be any black yet unknown grief,
  If there be any horror yet unfelt,                              290
  Unthought of mischief in thy fiend-like power,
  Dash it upon my miserable head;
  Make me more wretch, more curs�d if thou canst!
  O, now my fate is more than I could fear:
  My woes more weighty than my soul can bear.                [_Exit._

  _Pan._ Ha, ha, ha!

  _Alb._ Why laugh you, uncle? That's my coz, your son,
  Whose breast hangs cas�d in his cluttered[233] gore.

  _Pan._ True, man, true: why, wherefore should I weep?
  Come, sit, kind nephew: come on; thou and I                     300
  Will talk as chorus to this tragedy.
  Entreat the music strain their instruments
  With a slight touch, whilst we--Say on, fair coz.

  _Alb._ He was the very hope of Italy,

                                              [_Music sounds softly._

  The blooming honour of your drooping age.

  _Pan._ True, coz, true. They say that men of hope are crush'd;
  Good are supprest by base desertless clods,
  That stifle gasping virtue. Look, sweet youth,
  How provident our quick Venetians are,
  Lest hooves of jades should trample on my boy:                  310
  Look how they lift him up to eminence,
  Heave him 'bove reach of flesh. Ha, ha, ha!

  _Alb._ Uncle, this laughter ill becomes your grief.

  _Pan._ Would'st have me cry, run raving up and down,
  For my son's loss? Would'st have me turn rank mad,
  Or wring my face with mimic action;
  Stamp, curse, weep, rage, and then my bosom strike?
  Away, 'tis aspish action, player-like.[234]
  If he is guiltless, why should tears be spent?
  Thrice bless�d soul that dieth innocent.                        320
  If he is leper'd with so foul a guilt,
  Why should a sigh be lent, a tear be spilt?
  The gripe of chance is weak to wring a tear
  From him that knows what fortitude should bear.
  Listen, young blood. 'Tis not true valour's pride
  To swagger, quarrel, swear, stamp, rave, and chide,
  To stab in fume of blood, to keep loud coil[s]
  To bandy factions in domestic broils,
  To dare the act of sins, whose filth excels
  The blackest customs of blind infidels.                         330
  No, my lov'd youth: he may of valour vaunt
  Whom fortune's loudest thunder cannot daunt;
  Whom fretful gales of chance, stern fortune's siege,
  Makes not his reason slink, the soul's fair liege;
  Whose well-pais'd[235] action ever rests upon
  Not giddy humours but discretion.
  This heart in valour even Jove out-goes:
  Jove is without, but this 'bove sense of woes:[236]
  And such a one, eternity. Behold--
  Good morrow, son; thou bid'st a fig for cold.                   340
  Sound louder music: let my breath exact              [_Loud music._
  You strike sad tones unto this dismal act.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [207] Wrinkled.

     [208] Affianced.

     [209] Spur-royal was a gold coin worth fifteen shillings.

     [210] Nobles.

     [211] Embroidered (_Fr._ pourfiler).

     [212] To make a horse _tread the ring_ was an equestrian feat.
     The _ring_ was the circular piece of ground on which the horse
     displayed his agility. See note on Middleton, vol. i. p. 190.

     [213] Stockado, stoccata,--a thrust in fencing.

     [214] Grin or snarl.

     [215] "_Couleur de Roy_ was in the old time Purple; but now is
     the bright Tawnie which wee also tearme _Coulour de
     Roy_."--_Cotgrave._

     [216] A counterfeit coin.

     [217] A reminiscence of Virgil:--
          "Tum gelidus toto manabat corpore sudor:
          Corripio e stratis corpus."--_�n._ iii. 174-5.

     [218] Again we are reminded of Virgil:--
          "Ter conatus ibi collo dare brachia circum,
          Ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago."--_�n._ vi, 699-700.

     [219] For "I oped" old eds. give "top't."

     [220] Old form of "monsieur."--Balurdo is talking arrant
     nonsense.

     [221] The dramatists are fond of punning on the words, (1) bewray
     (betray), (2) beray (befoul). Cf. Middleton, i. 82, &c.

     [222] Old eds. "gellied," which I take to be _jellied_--not
     _gelid_. In the first edition of Shelley's _Cenci_ (iv. 3) we
     have:--"The _gellyed blood_ runs freely through my veins:" later
     editions read _jellied_.

     [223] Old eds. "flow."

     [224] Not marked in ed. 1602.

     [225] Reproach, upbraid.

     [226] "Luxurious twines"--lustful embraces.

     [227] Old eds. "maine."

     [228] So ed. 1602.--Ed. 1633, "swounded."

     [229] The metrical harshness might be removed by reading "A
     father dead, a wife dishonour'd."

     [230] Affections, feelings.

     [231] Old eds. "and let's sit."

     [232] Saucy fellow.

     [233] "'_Grumean de sang_, a clot or _clutter_ of congealed
     blood,' Cotgrave. _Cluttered_ blood, 'Holinshed, _Hist. Engl._ p.
     74.'"--_Halliwell._

     [234] There seems to be an allusion to old Hieronymo's frantic
     behaviour in _The Spanish Tragedy_.

     [235] Well-balanced.

     [236] A Stoic sentiment. Seneca writes:--"Est aliquid quo sapiens
     antecedat deum: ille beneficio natur� non timet, suo sapiens."
     (_Ep. Mor._, Lib. vi, Ep. 1.) But see particularly the quotation
     from Seneca on p. 133.




                              ACT II.


                             SCENE I.

                          _A dumb show._

                   _The cornets sound a senet._

  _Enter two mourners with torches, two with streamers_; CASTILIO
  _and_ FOROBOSCO, _with torches; a Herald bearing_ ANDRUGIO'S _helm
  and sword; the coffin_; MARIA _supported by_ LUCIO _and_ ALBERTO;
  _Antonio_, _by himself_; PIERO _and_ STROTZO, _talking_; GALEATZO
  _and_ MATZAGENTE, BALURDO _and_ PANDULFO: _the coffin set down;
  helm, sword, and streamers hung up, placed by the Herald, whilst_
  ANTONIO _and Maria wet their handkerchers with their tears, kiss
  them, and lay them on the hearse, kneeling: all go out but_ PIERO.
  _Cornets cease, and he speaks._

  _Pier._ Rot there, thou cerecloth that enfolds the flesh
  Of my loath'd foe; moulder to crumbling dust;
  Oblivion choke the passage of thy fame!
  Trophies of honour'd birth drop quickly down:
  Let nought of him, but what was vicious, live.
  Though thou art dead, think not my hate is dead:
  I have but newly twone my arm in the curl'd locks
  Of snaky vengeance. Pale, beetle-brow'd hate
  But newly bustles up. Sweet wrong, I clap thy thoughts!
  O let me hug thy[237] bosom, rub thy[237] breast,              10
  In hope of what may hap. Andrugio rots,
  Antonio lives: umh: how long? ha, ha! how long?
  Antonio pack'd hence, I'll his mother wed,
  Then clear my daughter of suppos�d lust,
  Wed her to Florence heir. O excellent!
  Venice, Genoa, Florence at my beck,
  At Piero's nod.--Balurdo, O ho![238]--
  O 'twill be rare, all unsuspected done.
  I have been nursed in blood, and still have suck'd
  The steam of reeking gore.--Balurdo, ho!                         20

         _Enter_ BALURDO _with a beard, half off, half on_.

  _Bal._ When my beard is on, most noble prince, when
  my beard is on.

  _Pier._ Why, what dost thou with a beard?

  _Bal._ In truth, one told me that my wit was bald, and
  that a mermaid was half fish and half fish [_sic_]; and therefore
  to speak wisely, like one of your counsel, as indeed
  it hath pleased you to make me, not only being a fool of
  your counsel, but also to make me of your counsel being
  a fool: if my wit be bald, and a mermaid be half fish and
  half conger, then I must be forced to conclude--The
  tiring man hath not glued on my beard half fast enough.
  God's bores, it will not stick to fall off.                      32

  _Pier._ Dost thou know what thou hast spoken all this while?

  _Bal._ O lord, duke, I would be sorry of that. Many
  men can utter that which no man but themselves can
  conceive: but I thank a good wit, I have the gift to speak
  that which neither any man else nor myself understands.

  _Pier._ Thou art wise. He that speaks he knows not
  what, shall never sin against his own conscience: go to,
  thou art wise.                                                   40

  _Bal._ Wise? O no, I have a little natural discretion,
  or so; but for wise, I am somewhat prudent; but for
  wise, O lord!

  _Pier._ Hold, take those keys, open the castle vault,
  And put in Mellida.

  _Bal._ And put in Mellida? Well, let me alone.

  _Pier._ Bid Forobosco and Castilio guard;
  Endear thyself Piero's intimate.

  _Bal._ Endear, and intimate; good, I assure you. I
  will endear and intimate Mellida into the dungeon
  presently.                                                       51

  _Pier._ Will[239] Pandulfo Feliche wait on me.

  _Bal._ I will make him come, most retort and obtuse,
  to you presently. I think Sir Jeffrey talks like a counsellor.
  Go to, god's neaks, I think I tickle it.

  _Pier._ I'll seem to wind yon fool with kindest arm.
  He that's ambitious-minded, and but man,
  Must have his followers beasts, damn'd[240] slavish sots,
  Whose service is obedience, and whose wit
  Reacheth no further than to admire their lord,                   60
  And stare in adoration of his worth.
  I loathe a slave, raked out of common mud,
  Should seem to sit in counsel with my heart.
  High-honour'd blood's too squeamish to assent
  And lend a hand to an ignoble act:
  Poison from roses who could e'er abstract?--

                         _Enter_ PANDULFO.

  How now, Pandulfo? weeping for thy son?

  _Pan._ No, no, Piero, weeping for my sins:
  Had I been a good father, he had been
  A gracious son.

  _Pier._ Pollution must be purged.                                70

  _Pan._ Why taint'st thou then the air with stench of flesh,
  And human putrefaction's noisome scent?
  I pray his body. Who less boon can crave
  Than to bestow upon the dead his grave?

  _Pier._ Grave! Why, think'st thou he deserves a grave,
  That hath defil'd the temple of----

  _Pan._ Peace, peace!
  Methinks I hear a humming murmur creep
  From out his jellied[241] wounds. Look on those lips,
  Those now lawn pillows, on whose tender softness
  Chaste modest speech, stealing from out his breast,              80
  Had wont to rest itself, as loath to post
  From out so fair an inn! look, look, they seem to stir
  And breathe defiance to black obloquy!

  _Pier._ Think'st thou thy son could suffer wrongfully?

  _Pan._ A wise man wrongfully, but never wrong
  Can take;[242] his breast's of such well-tempered proof
  It may be razed, not pierced by savage tooth
  Of foaming malice: showers of darts may dark
  Heaven's ample brow, but not strike out a spark,
  Much less pierce the sun's cheek. Such songs as these
  I often dittied till my boy did sleep;                           91
  But now I turn plain fool, alas, I weep.

  _Pier._ [_Aside._] 'Fore heaven he makes me shrug; would 'a
     were dead.
  He is a virtuous man: what has our court to do
  With virtue, in the devil's name!--Pandulpho, hark:
  My lustful daughter dies; start not, she dies.
  I pursue justice; I love sanctity,
  And an undefiled temple of pure thoughts.
  Shall I speak freely? Good Andrugio's dead:
  And I do fear a fetch;[243] but (umh) would I durst speak--
  I do mistrust but (umh)--[_Aside._] Death is he all, all man,
  Hath he no part of mother in him, ha?                           102
  No licorish womanish inquisitiveness?

  _Pan._ Andrugio's dead!

  _Pier._ Ay; and I fear his own unnatural blood,
  To whom he gave life, hath given death for life.
  [_Aside_.] How could he come on? I see false suspect
  Is viced; wrung hardly in a virtuous heart.--
  Well, I could give you reason for my doubts:
  You are of honour'd birth, my very friend:                      110
  You know how god-like 'tis to root out sin.
  Antonio is a villain: will you join
  In oath with me against the traitor's life,
  And swear you knew he sought his father's death?
  I loved him well, yet I love justice more:
  Our friends we should affect, justice adore.

  _Pan._ My lord, the clapper of my mouth's not glibb'd
  With court-oil, 'twill not strike on both sides yet.

  _Pier._ 'Tis[244] just that subjects act commands of kings.

  _Pan._ Command then just and honourable things.                 120

  _Pier._ Even so, myself then will traduce his guilt.

  _Pan._ Beware, take heed, lest guiltless blood be spilt.

  _Pier._ Where only honest deeds to kings are free,
  It is no empire, but a beggary.

  _Pan._ Where more than noble deeds to kings are free,
  It is no empire, but a tyranny.

  _Pier._ Tush, juiceless graybeard, 'tis immunity,
  Proper to princes, that our state exacts;
  Our subjects not alone to bear, but praise our acts.            129

  _Pan._ O, but that prince, that worthful praise aspires,
  From hearts, and not from lips, applause desires.

  _Pier._ Pish!
  True praise the brow of common men doth ring,
  False only girts the temple of a king.
  He that hath strength and 's ignorant of power,
  He was not made to rule, but to be rul'd.

  _Pan._ 'Tis praise to do, not what we can, but should.

  _Pier._ Hence, doting stoic! by my hope of bliss,
  I'll make thee wretched.

  _Pan._ Defiance to thy power, thou rifted jawn![245]            140
  Now, by the lov�d heaven, sooner thou shalt
  Rinse thy foul ribs from the black filth of sin
  That soots thy heart than make me wretched. Pish!
  Thou canst not coop me up. Hadst thou a jail
  With treble walls, like antique Babylon,
  Pandulpho can get out. I tell thee, duke,
  I have old Fortunatus' wishing-cap,
  And can be where I list even in a trice.
  I'll skip from earth into the arms of heaven:
  And from triumphal arch of blessedness,                         150
  Spit on thy frothy breast. Thou canst not slave
  Or banish me; I will be free at home,
  Maugre the beard of greatness. The port-holes
  Of sheath�d spirit are ne'er corb�d[246] up,
  But still stand open ready to discharge
  Their precious shot into the shrouds of heaven.

  _Pier._ O torture! slave, I banish thee the town,
  Thy native seat of birth.

  _Pan._ How proud thou speak'st! I tell thee, duke, the blasts   159
  Of the swoll'n-cheek'd winds, nor all the breath of kings
  Can puff me out my native seat of birth.
  The earth's my body's, and the heaven's my soul's
  Most native place of birth, which they will keep
  Despite the menace of mortality.
  Why, duke,
  That's not my native place,[247] where I was rock'd.
  A wise man's home is wheresoe'er he is wise;
  Now that, from man, not from the place, doth rise.

  _Pier._ Would I were deaf! O plague! Hence, dotard wretch!
  Tread not in court: all that thou hast, I seize.                170
  [_Aside._] His quiet's firmer than I can disease.

  _Pan._ Go, boast unto thy flatt'ring sycophants
  Pandulpho's slave Piero hath o'erthrown:
  Loose fortune's rags are lost, my own's my own.

                                      [PIERO _going out, looks back_.

  'Tis true, Piero, thy vex'd heart shall see,
  Thou hast but tripp'd my slave, not conquered me.

                                          [_Exeunt at several doors._


     [237] So ed. 1633.--Ed. 1602 "my."

     [238] We are to suppose that Piero has left the church and is in
     the courtyard of the palace.

     [239] _i.e._, desire, order.

     [240] Old eds. "dub'd."

     [241] See note 2, p. 114.

     [242] Pandulpho is again ready with his Stoic maxims. Seneca
     wrote a dissertation to show "Nec injuriam nec contumeliam
     accipere sapientem."

     [243] "I do fear a _fetch_," _i.e._, I suspect that
     Andrugio has perished by treachery. _Fetch_ = plot, device.

     [244] There is an Attic flavour in this passage of
     _stichomythia_. For a passing moment one is reminded of
     Creon's altercation with his son (in the _Antigone_):--
          Kr. � pankakiste, dia dik�s i�n patri.
          Hai. ou gar dikaia s' examartanonth hor�.
          Kr. hamartan� gar tas emas archas seb�n?
          Hai. ou gar sebeis, timas ge tas the�n pat�n.

     [245] Marston uses indifferently the forms _chawn_ and _jawn_ for
     a rift or chasm.

     [246] "Corb�d" (old eds. "corb'd") is "good," as Polonius would
     say; but I have no suspicion as to its meaning. It would be a
     pity to suggest an emendation.

     [247] Seneca is fond of harping on this theme. "In ultimas
     expellaris terras licebit," he writes in one of his epistles, "in
     quolibet barbari� angulo colloceris, hospitalis tibi illa
     qualiscumque sedes erit; magis quis veneris quam quo, interest,
     et ideo nulli loco addicere debemus arbitrium. Cum hac
     persuasione vivendum est: 'Non sum uni angulo natus, patria mea
     totus hic mundus est.'"


                             SCENE II.

                   _Before the palace of_ PIERO.

   _Enter_ ANTONIO, _in black, with a book_; LUCIO _and_ ALBERTO.

  _Alb._ Nay, sweet, be comforted, take counsel and----.

  _Ant._ Alberto, peace: that grief is wanton-sick,
  Whose stomach can digest and brook the diet
  Of stale ill-relish'd counsel. Pigmy cares
  Can shelter under patience' shield; but giant griefs
  Will burst all covert.

  _Lu._ My lord, 'tis supper time.

  _Ant._ Drink deep, Alberto; eat, good Lucio;
  But my pined heart shall eat on nought but woe.

  _Alb._ My lord, we dare not leave you thus alone.

  _Ant._ You cannot leave Antonio alone.                           10
  The chamber of my breast is even throng'd
  With firm attendance that forswears to flinch.
  I have a thing sits here; it is not grief,
  'Tis not despair, nor the [ut]most plague
  That the most wretched are infected with;
  But the most griefful,[248] [most] despairing, wretched,
  Accurs�d, miserable--O, for heaven's sake
  Forsake me now; you see how light I am,
  And yet you force me to defame my patience.

  _Lu._ Fair gentle prince----.                                    20

  _Ant._ Away, thy voice is hateful: thou dost buzz,
  And beat my ears with intimations
  That Mellida, that Mellida is light,
  And stain�d with adulterous luxury!
  I cannot brook't. I tell thee, Lucio,
  Sooner will I give faith that Virtue's cant[249]
  In princes' courts will be adorn'd with wreath
  Of choice respect, and endear'd intimate;
  Sooner will I believe that friendship's rein
  Will curb ambition from utility,                                 30
  Than Mellida is light. Alas, poor soul,
  Didst e'er see her?--good heart!--hast heard her speak?
  Kind, kind soul! Incredulity itself
  Would not be so brass-hearted, as suspect
  So modest cheeks.

  _Lu._ My lord----.

  _Ant._ Away!
  A self-sown[250] guilt doth only hatch distrust;
  But a chaste thought's as far from doubt as lust.
  I entreat you, leave me.

  _Alb._ Will you endeavour to forget your grief?

  _Ant._ I'faith I will, good friend, i'faith I will.              40
  I'll come and eat with you. Alberto, see,
  I am taking physic, here's philosophy.
  Good honest, leave me, I'll drink wine anon.

  _Alb._ Since you enforce us, fair prince, we are gone.

                                       [_Exeunt_ ALBERTO _and_ LUCIO.

                         ANTONIO _reads_.

  _A. Ferte[251] fortiter: hoc est quo deum antecedatis. Ille
  enim extra patientiam malorum, vos supra. Contemnite
  dolorem: aut solvetur, aut solvet. Contemnite fortunam:
  nullum telum, quo feriret animum habet._[252]

  Pish, thy mother was not lately widow�d,
  Thy dear affi�d love lately defam'd                              50
  With blemish of foul lust, when thou wrotest thus;
  Thou wrapt in furs, beaking[253] thy limbs 'fore fires;
  Forbid'st the frozen zone to shudder. Ha, ha! 'tis nought
  But foamy bubbling of a fleamy[254] brain,
  Nought else but smoke. O what dank marish spirit,
  But would be fired with impatience
  At my----
  No more, no more; he that was never blest
  With height of birth, fair expectation
  Of mounted fortunes, knows not what it is                        60
  To be the pitied object of the world.
  O, poor Antonio, thou may'st sigh!

  _Mel._ [_from beneath._] Ay me!

  _Ant._ And curse.

  _Pan._ [_from within._] Black powers!

  _Ant._ And cry.

  _Mar._ [_from within._] O Heaven!

  _Ant._ And close laments with----.

  _Mel._[255] [_from beneath._] O me, most miserable!

  _Pan._ Woe for my dear, dear son!                                70

  _Mar._ Woe for my dear, dear husband!

  _Mel._ Woe for my dear, dear love!

  _Ant._ Woe for me all, close all your woes in me!
  In me, Antonio!--ha! where live these sounds?
  I can see nothing; grief's invisible,
  And lurks in secret angles of the heart.
  Come, sigh again, Antonio bears his part.

  _Mel._ O here, here is a vent to pass my sighs.
  I have surcharged the dungeon with my plaints.
  Prison and heart will burst, if void of vent.                    80
  Ay, that is Phoebe, empress of the night,
  That 'gins to mount; O chastest deity,
  If I be false to my Antonio,
  If the least soil of lust smears my pure love,
  Make me more wretched, make me more accurs'd
  Than infamy, torture, death, hell, and heaven,
  Can bound with amplest power of thought: if not,
  Purge my poor heart from[256] defamation's blot.

  _Ant._ Purge my poor heart from defamation's blot!
  Poor heart, how like her virtuous self she speaks.--             90
  Mellida, dear Mellida! it is Antonio:
  Slink not away, 'tis thy Antonio.

  _Mel._ How found you out, my lord? Alas! I know
  'Tis easy in this age to find out woe.
  I have a suit to you.

  _Ant._ What is't, dear soul?

  _Mel._ Kill me; i'faith I'll wink, not stir a jot.
  For God sake kill me; in sooth, lov�d youth,
  I am much injur'd; look, see how I creep.
  I cannot wreak my wrong, but sigh and weep.

  _Ant._ May I be curs�d, but I credit thee.                      100

  _Mel._ To-morrow I must die.

  _Ant._ Alas, for what?

  _Mel._ For loving thee. 'Tis true, my sweetest breast,
  I must die falsely: so must thou, dear heart.
  Nets are a-knitting to entrap thy life.
  Thy father's death must make a paradise
  To my (I shame to call him) father. Tell me, sweet,
  Shall I die thine? dost love me still, and still?

  _Ant._ I do.

  _Mal._ Then welcome heaven's will.

  _Ant._ Madam, I will not swell, like a tragedian,
  In forc�d passion of affected strains.                          110
  If I had present power of ought but pitying you,
  I would be as ready to redress your wrongs
  As to pursue your love. Throngs of thoughts
  Crowd for their passage; somewhat I will do.
  Reach me thy hand; think this is honour's bent,
  To live unslav�d, to die innocent.

  _Mel._ Let me entreat a favour, gracious love.
  Be patient, see me die; good, do not weep:
  Go sup, sweet chuck, drink, and securely sleep.

  _Ant._ I'faith I cannot; but I'll force my face                 120
  To palliate my sickness.

  _Mel._ Give me thy hand. Peace on thy bosom dwell:
  That's all my woe can breathe. Kiss: thus, farewell.

  _Ant._ Farewell: my heart is great of thoughts; stay, dove:
  And therefore I must speak: but what? O love!
  By this white hand: no more: read in these tears,
  What crushing anguish thy Antonio bears.

                    [ANTONIO _kisseth_ MELLIDA'S _hand: then_ MELLIDA
                        _goes from the grate_.

  Mel._ Good night, good heart.

  _Ant._ Thus heat from blood, thus souls from bodies part.       129

                   _Enter_ PIERO _and_ STROTZO.

  _Pier._ He grieves; laugh, Strotzo, laugh. He weeps.
  Hath he tears? O pleasure! hath he tears?
  Now do I scourge Andrugio with steel whips
  Of knotty vengeance. Strotzo, cause me straight
  Some plaining ditty to augment despair.

                                                     [_Exit_ STROTZO.

  Triumph, Piero: hark, he groans. O rare!

  _Ant._ Behold a prostrate wretch laid on his tomb.
  His epitaph, thus: _Ne plus ultra_. Ho!
  Let none out-woe me: mine's Herculean woe.

            [_A song within._--_Exit_ PIERO _at the end of the song_.

                          _Enter_ MARIA.

  _Ant._ May I be more cursed than Heaven can make me, if
  I'm not more wretched than man can conceive me.                 140
  Sore forlorn orphant, what omnipotence
  Can make thee happy?

  _Mar._ How now, sweet son? Good youth,
  What dost thou?

  _Ant._ Weep, weep.

  _Mar._ Dost nought but weep, weep?

  _Ant._ Yes, mother, I do sigh, and wring my hands,
  Beat my poor breast, and wreathe my tender arms.
  Hark ye; I'll tell you wondrous strange, strange news.

  _Mar._ What, my good boy, stark mad?

  _Ant._ I am not.

  _Mar._ Alas!
  Is that strange news?                                           150

  _Ant._ Strange news? why, mother, is't not wondrous strange
  I am not mad--I run not frantic, ha?
  Knowing, my father's trunk scarce cold, your love
  Is sought by him that doth pursue my life!
  Seeing the beauty of creation,
  Antonio's bride, pure heart, defamed, and stowed
  Under the hatches of obscuring earth!
  _Heu, quo labor, quo vota ceciderunt mea!_

                           _Enter_ PIERO.

  _Pier._ Good evening to the fair Antonio;
  Most happy fortune, sweet succeeding time,                      160
  Rich hope: think not thy fate a bankrout,[257] though----

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] Umh! the devil in his good time and tide
     forsake thee.

  _Pier._ How now? hark ye, prince.

  _Ant._ God be with you.

  _Pier._ Nay, noble blood, I hope ye not suspect----

  _Ant._ Suspect! I scorn't. Here's cap and leg, good night.
  [_Aside._] Thou that wants power, with dissemblance fight.

                                                     [_Exit_ ANTONIO.

  _Pier._ Madam, O that you could remember to forget----

  _Mar._ I had a husband and a happy son.

  _Pier._ Most powerful beauty, that enchanting grace----

  _Mar._ Talk not of beauty, nor enchanting grace,----            170
  My husband's dead, my son's distraught, accurs'd!
  Come, I must vent my griefs, or heart will burst.

                                                       [_Exit_ MARIA.

  _Pier._ She's gone, and yet she's here: she hath left a print
  Of her sweet graces fix'd within my heart,
  As fresh as is her face. I'll marry her.
  She's most fair,--true; most chaste,--false;[258] because
  Most fair, 'tis firm I'll marry her.

                          _Enter_ STROTZO.

  _Str._ My lord.

  _Pier._ Ha, Strotzo, my other soul, my life!
  Dear, hast thou steel'd the point of thy resolve?
  Will't not turn edge in execution?

  _Str._ No.                                                      180

  _Pier._ Do it with rare passion, and present thy guilt
  As if 'twere wrung out with thy conscience' gripe.
  Swear that my daughter's innocent of lust,
  And that Antonio bribed thee to defame
  Her maiden honour, on inveterate hate
  Unto my blood; and that thy hand was feed
  By his large bounty for his father's death.
  Swear plainly that thou choked'st Andrugio,
  By his son's only egging. Rush me in
  Whilst Mellida prepares herself to die,                        190
  Halter about thy neck, and with such sighs,
  Laments, and applications lifen it,
  As if impulsive power of remorse----

  _Str._ I'll weep.

  _Pier._ Ay, ay, fall on thy face and cry "why suffer you
  So lewd a slave as Strotzo is to breathe?"

  _Str._ I'll beg a strangling, grow importunate----

  _Pier._ As if thy life were loathsome to thee: then I
  Catch straight the cord's end; and, as much incens'd
  With thy damn'd mischiefs, offer a rude hand                    200
  As ready to gird in thy pipe of breath;
  But on the sudden straight I'll stand amaz'd,
  And fall in exclamations of thy virtues.

  _Str._ Applaud my agonies and penitence.

  _Pier._ Thy honest stomach, that could not disgest[259]
  The crudities of murder, but surcharged,
  Vomited'st them up in Christian piety.

  _Str._ Then clip me in your arms.

  _Pier._ And call thee brother, mount thee straight to state,
  Make thee of council: tut, tut, what not? what not?             210
  Think on't, be confident, pursue the plot.

  _Str._ Look, here's a trope: a true rogue's lips are mute,
  I do not use to speak, but execute.

         [_He lays finger on his mouth, and draws his dagger.--Exit._

  _Pier._ So, so; run headlong to confusion:
  Thou slight-brain'd mischief, thou art made as dirt,
  To plaster up the bracks[260] of my defects.
  I'll wring what may be squeezed from out his use,
  And good night, Strotzo. Swell plump, bold heart;
  For now thy tide of vengeance rolleth in:
  O now _Tragoedia Cothurnata_[261] mounts,                       220
  Piero's thoughts are fix'd on dire exploits.
  Pell mell--confusion and black murder guides
  The organs of my spirit: shrink not, heart!
  _Capienda[262] rebus in malis pr�ceps via est._

                                                             [_Exit._

                             ACT III.


                             SCENE I.

          _A dumb show. The cornets sounding for the Act._

  _Enter_ CASTILIO _and_ FOROBOSCO, ALBERTO _and_ BALURDO, _with
  poleaxes_; PIERO, _talking with_ STROTZO, _seemeth to send him out:
  exit_ STROTZO. _Re-enter_ STROTZO _with_ MARIA, NUTRICHE, _and_
  LUCIO. PIERO _passeth through his guard, and talks with_ MARIA _with
  seeming amorousness; she seemeth to reject his suit, flies to the
  tomb, kneels, and kisseth it_. PIERO _bribes_ NUTRICHE _and_ LUCIO;
  _they go to her, seeming to solicit his suit. She riseth, offers to
  go out_; PIERO _stayeth her, tears open his breast, embraceth and
  kisseth her; and so they go all out in state_.

  _After the dumb show enter two_ Pages, _the one with tapers, the
  other holding a chafing-dish with a perfume in it_; ANTONIO, _in his
  night-gown and a night-cap, unbraced, following after_.

  _Ant._ The black jades of swart night trot foggy rings[263]
  'Bout heaven's brow: [_clock strikes twelve_] 'tis now stark dead
     night.
  Is this Saint Mark's Church?

  _1st Pa._ It is, my lord.

  _Ant._ Where stands my father's hearse?

  _2d Pa._ Those streamers bear his arms. Ay, that is it.

  _Ant._ Set tapers to the tomb, and lamp the church:
  Give me the fire.--Now depart and sleep.

                                                     [_Exeunt_ Pages.

  I purify the air with odorous fume.
  Graves, vaults, and tombs, groan not to bear my weight;
  Cold flesh, bleak trunks, wrapt in your half-rot shrouds,
  I press you softly with a tender foot.                           11
  Most honour'd sepulchre, vouchsafe a wretch
  Leave to weep o'er thee. Tomb, I'll not be long
  Ere I creep in thee, and with bloodless lips
  Kiss my cold father's cheek. I prithee, grave,
  Provide soft mold to wrap my carcass in.
  Thou royal spirit of Andrugio,
  Where'er thou hover'st, airy intellect,
  I heave up tapers to thee (view thy son)
  In celebration of due obsequies;                                 20
  Once every night I'll dew thy funeral hearse
  With my religious tears.
  O, bless�d father of a curs�d son,
  Thou died'st most happy, since thou lived'st not
  To see thy son most wretched, and thy wife
  Pursued by him that seeks my guiltless blood!
  O, in what orb thy mighty spirit soars,
  Stoop and beat down this rising fog of shame,
  That strives to blur thy blood, and girt defame
  About my innocent and spotless brows.                            30
  _Non est mori miserum, sed misere mori._

                                        [_Ghost of_ ANDRUGIO _rises_.

  _Ghost of And._ Thy pangs of anguish rip my cerecloth up,
  And, lo, the ghost of old Andrugio
  Forsakes his coffin. Antonio, revenge!
  I was empoison'd by Piero's hand.
  Revenge my blood! take spirit, gentle boy;
  Revenge my blood! Thy Mellida is chaste:
  Only to frustrate thy pursuit in love,
  Is blazed unchaste. Thy mother yields consent
  To be his wife, and give his blood a son,                        40
  That made her husbandless, and doth complot
  To make her sonless; but before I touch
  The banks of rest, my ghost shall visit her.
  Thou vigour of my youth, juice of my love,
  Seize on revenge, grasp the stern-bended front
  Of frowning vengeance with unpaiz'd[264] clutch.[265]
  Alarum Nemesis, rouse up thy blood!
  Invent some stratagem of vengeance,
  Which, but to think on, may like lightning glide
  With horror through thy breast! Remember this:                   50
  _Scelera[266] non ulcisceris, nisi vincis_.

                                          [_Exit_ ANDRUGIO'S _ghost_.

      _Enter_ MARIA, _her hair about her ears_; NUTRICHE _and_
                 LUCIO, _with Pages, and torches_.

  _Mar._ Where left you him? show me, good boys, away!

  _Nut._ God's me, your hair!

  _Mar._ Nurse, 'tis not yet proud day:
  The neat gay mists of the light's not up,
  Her cheek's not yet slur'd over with the paint
  Of borrow'd crimson; the unprank�d world
  Wears yet the night-clothes. Let flare my loos�d hair!
  I scorn the presence of the night.--
  Where's my boy?--Run: I'll range about the church,
  Like frantic Bacchanal or Jason's wife,                          60
  Invoking all the spirits of the graves
  To tell me where.--Ha? O my poor wretched blood!
  What dost thou up at midnight, my kind boy?
  Dear soul, to bed! O thou hast struck a fright
  Unto thy mother's panting----

  _Ant._[267] _O quisquis nova
  Supplicia functis dirus umbrarum arbiter
  Disponis, quisquis exeso jaces
  Pavidus sub antro,[268] quisquis venturi times
  Montis ruinam, quisquis avidorum feros[269]
  Rictus leonum, et dira furiarum agmina_                          70
  _Implicitus horres, Antonii vocem excipe
  Properantis ad vos--Ulciscar!_

  _Mar._ Alas! my son's distraught. Sweet boy, appease
  Thy mutining affections.

  _Ant._ By the astonning terror of swart night,
  By the infectious damps of clammy graves,
  And[270] by the mould that presseth down
  My dead father's skull, I'll be revenged!

  _Mar._ Wherefore? on whom? for what? Go, go to bed,
  Good, duteous son. Ho, but thy idle----                          80

  _Ant._ So I may sleep tomb'd in an honour'd hearse,
  So may my bones rest in that sepulchre,----

  _Mar._ Forget not duty, son: to bed, to bed.

  _Ant._ May I be curs�d by my father's ghost,
  And blasted with incens�d breath of Heaven,
  If my heart beat[271] on ought but vengeance!
  May I be numb'd with horror, and my veins
  Pucker with singeing torture, if my brain
  Disgest[272] a thought but of dire vengeance;
  May I be fetter'd slave to coward Chance,                        90
  If blood, heart, brain, plot ought save vengeance.

  _Mar._ Wilt thou to bed? I wonder when thou sleep'st!
  I'faith thou look'st sunk-ey'd; go couch thy head:
  Now, faith, 'tis idle: sweet, sweet son, to bed.

  _Ant._ I have a prayer or two to offer up
  For the good, good prince, my most dear, dear lord,
  The duke Piero, and your virtuous self;
  And then, when those prayers have obtain'd success,
  In sooth I'll come (believe it now) and couch
  My head in downy mould. But first I'll see                      100
  You safely laid: I'll bring ye all to bed.
  Piero, Maria, Strotzo, Lucio,
  I'll see you all laid: I'll bring you all to bed,
  And then, i'faith, I'll come and couch my head,
  And sleep in peace.

  _Mar._ Look then, we go before.

                                            [_Exeunt all but_ ANTONIO.

  _Ant._ Ay, so you must, before we touch the shore
  Of wish'd revenge. O, you departed souls,
  That lodge in coffin'd trunks, which my feet press,
  (If Pythagorean Axioms be true,
  Of spirits' transmigration) fleet no more                       110
  To human bodies, rather live in swine,
  Inhabit wolves' flesh, scorpions, dogs, and toads,
  Rather than man. The curse of Heaven rains
  In plagues unlimited through all his days:
  His mature age grows only mature vice,
  And ripens only to corrupt and rot
  The budding hopes of infant modesty.
  Still striving to be more than man, he proves
  More than a devil. Devilish suspect,
  Devilish cruelty,                                               120
  All hell-strai[n']d juice is pour�d to his veins,
  Making him drunk with fuming surquedries;[273]
  Contempt of Heaven, untam'd arrogance,
  Lust, state, pride, murder.

  _Ghost of And._ Murder!  }
  _Ghost of Feli._ Murder! } _From above and beneath._
  _Pan._[274] Murder!      }

  _Ant._ Ay, I will murder: graves and ghosts
  Fright me no more, I'll suck red vengeance
  Out of Piero's wounds, Piero's wounds!

                                 [_Retires to the back of the stage._

  _Enter two boys, with_ PIERO _in his night-gown and
  night-cap_.

  _Pier._ Maria, love, Maria! she took this aisle.
  Left you her here? On, lights, away!
  I think we shall not warm our beds to-day.                      130

                  _Enter_ JULIO, FOROBOSCO, _and_ CASTILIO.

  _Jul._ Ho, father! father!

  _Pier._ How now, Julio, my little pretty son?
  Why suffer you the child to walk so late?

  _For._ He will not sleep, but calls to follow you,
  Crying that bug-bears and spirits haunted him.

                       [ANTONIO _offers to come near and stab_; PIERO
                          _presently withdraws_.

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] No, not so.
  This shall be sought for; I'll force him feed on life
  Till he shall loath it. This shall be the close
  Of vengeance' strain.

  _Pier._ Away there, pages, lead on fast with light;             140
  The church is full of damps; 'tis yet dead night.

                           [_Exeunt all, saving_ JULIO _and_ ANTONIO.

  _Jul._ Brother Antonio, are you here, i'faith?
  Why do you frown? Indeed my sister said
  That I should call you brother, that she did,
  When you were married to her. Buss me: good truth,
  I love you better than my father, 'deed.

  _Ant._ Thy father? Gracious, O bounteous Heaven!
  I do adore thy justice: _venit in nostras manus
  Tandem vindicta, venit et tota quidem_.[275]

  _Jul._ Truth, since my mother died, I loved you best.           150
  Something hath anger'd you; pray you, look merrily.

  _Ant._ I will laugh, and dimple my thin cheek
  With cap'ring joy; chuck, my heart doth leap
  To grasp thy bosom.--[_Aside._] Time, place, and blood,
  How fit you close together! Heaven's tones
  Strike not such music to immortal souls
  As your accordance sweets my breast withal.
  Methinks I pace upon the front of Jove,
  And kick corruption with a scornful heel!
  Griping this flesh, disdain mortality!                          160
  O that I knew which joint, which side, which limb,
  Were father all, and had no mother in't,
  That I might rip it vein by vein, and carve revenge
  In bleeding races! but since 'tis mix'd together,
  Have at adventure, pell mell, no reverse.--
  Come hither, boy. This is Andrugio's hearse.

  _Jul._ O God, you'll hurt me. For my sister's sake,
  Pray you do not hurt me. And you kill me, 'deed,
  I'll tell my father.

  _Ant._ O, for thy sister's sake, I flag revenge.                170

  _Ghost of And._ Revenge!

  _Ant._ Stay, stay, dear father, fright mine eyes no more.
  Revenge as swift as lightning bursteth forth,
  And cleaves[276] his heart.--Come, pretty tender child,
  It is not thee I hate, not thee I kill.
  Thy father's blood that flows within thy veins,
  Is it I loathe; is that revenge must suck.
  I love thy soul: and were thy heart lapp'd up
  In any flesh but in Piero's blood,
  I would thus kiss it; but being his, thus, thus,                180
  And thus I'll punch it. Abandon fears:
  Whilst thy wounds bleed, my brows shall gush out tears.

  _Jul._ So you will love me, do even what you will.

  _Ant._ Now barks the wolf against the full-cheek'd moon;
  Now lions half-clam'd[277] entrails roar for food;
  Now croaks the toad, and night-crows screech aloud,
  Fluttering 'bout casements of departed souls;
  Now gapes the graves, and through their yawns let loose
  Imprison'd spirits to revisit earth;
  And now, swart night, to swell thy hour out,                    190
  Behold I spurt warm blood in thy black eyes.

                  [_He stabs_ JULIO.--_From under the stage a groan._

  Howl not, thou putry[278] mould; groan not, ye graves;
  Be dumb, all breath. Here stands Andrugio's son,
  Worthy his father. So: I feel no breath.
  His jaws are fall'n, his dislodg'd soul is fled:
  And now there's nothing but Piero left:
  He is all Piero, father all. This blood,
  This breast, this heart, Piero all:
  Whom thus I mangle. Sprite of Julio,
  Forget this was thy trunk. I live thy friend:                   200
  May'st thou be twin�d with the soft'st embrace
  Of clear eternity: but thy father's blood
  I thus make incense of to vengeance.
  Ghost of my poison'd sire, suck this fume:
  To sweet revenge perfume thy circling air
  With smoke of blood. I sprinkle round his gore,
  And dew thy hearse with these fresh-reeking drops.
  Lo thus I heave my blood-dyed hands to heaven,
  Even like insatiate hell still crying, More!
  My heart hath thirsting dropsies after gore.                    210
  Sound peace and rest to church, night-ghosts, and graves:
  Blood cries for blood, and murder murder craves.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Nut._ Fie, fie; to-morrow your wedding day, and
  weep! God's my comfort! Andrugio could do well:
  Piero may do better. I have had four husbands myself.
  The first I called, sweet duck; the second, dear heart;
  the third, pretty pug;[279] but the fourth, most sweet, dear,
  pretty, all in all; he was the very cockall of a husband.
  What, lady? your skin is smooth, your blood warm,
  your cheek fresh, your eye quick: change of pasture
  makes fat calves; choice of linen clean bodies, and (no
  question) variety of husbands perfect wives. I would
  you should know it: as few teeth as I have in my head,
  I have read _Aristotle's Problems_,[280] which saith that woman
  receiveth perfection by the man. What then be the
  men? Go to, to bed, lie on your back, dream not on
  Piero; I say no more. To-morrow is your wedding:
  go,[281] dream not of Piero.                                     16

                _Enter_ BALURDO _with a base viol_.

  _Mar._ What an idle prate thou keep'st, good nurse; go sleep.
  I have a mighty task of tears to weep.

  _Bal._ Lady, with a most retort and obtuse leg,
  I kiss the curl�d locks of your loose hair.                      20
  The Duke hath sent you the most musical Sir Jeffrey,
  with his not base, but most ennobled viol, to rock your
  baby thoughts in the cradle of sleep.

  _Mar._ I give the noble Duke respective[282] thanks.

  _Bal._ Respective; truly a very pretty word. Indeed,
  madam, I have the most respective fiddle; did you ever
  smell a more sweet sound? My ditty must go thus;
  very witty, I assure you: I myself in an humorous
  passion made it, to the tune of my mistress Nutriche's
  beauty. Indeed, very pretty, very retort, and obtuse,
  I'll assure you; 'tis thus:--                                    31

       My mistress' eye doth oil my joints,
         And makes my fingers nimble:
       O love, come on, untruss your points,
         My fiddlestick wants rozen.
       My lady's duggs are all so smooth,
         That no flesh must them handle:
       Her eyes do shine, for to say sooth,
         Like a new-snuff�d candle.

  _Mar._ Truly, very pathetical and unvulgar.                      40

  _Bal._ Pathetical and unvulgar; words of worth, excellent
  words. In sooth, madam, I have taken a murr,[283]
  which makes my nose run most pathetically, and unvulgarly.
  Have you any tobacco?

  _Mar._ Good Signior, your song.

  _Bal._ Instantly, most unvulgarly, at your service.
  Truly, here's the most pathetical rozen. Umh.

                                                           [_A Song._

  _Mar._ In sooth, most knightly sung, and like Sir Jeffrey.

  _Bal._ Why, look you, lady, I was made a knight
  only for my voice; and a councillor only for my wit.             51

  _Mar._ I believe it. Good night, gentle sir, good night.

  _Bal._ You will give me leave to take my leave of my
  mistress, and I will do it most famously in rhyme.

  Farewell, adieu! saith thy love true,
  As to part loath.
  Time bids us part, mine own sweet heart,
  God bless us both.

                                                     [_Exit_ BALURDO.

  _Mar._ Good night, Nutriche. Pages, leave the room.
  The life of night grows short, 'tis almost dead.                 60

                                        [_Exeunt Pages and_ NUTRICHE.

  O thou cold widow-bed, sometime thrice blest
  By the warm pressure of my sleeping lord,
  Open thy leaves, and whilst on thee I tread,
  Groan out,--Alas, my dear Andrugio's dead!

                       [MARIA _draweth the curtain: and the ghost of_
                         ANDRUGIO _is displayed, sitting on the bed_.

  Amazing terror, what portent is this!

  _Ghost of And._ Disloyal to our hymeneal[284] rites,
  What raging heat reigns in thy strumpet blood?
  Hast thou so soon forgot Andrugio?
  Are our love-bands so quickly cancell�d?
  Where lives thy plighted faith unto this breast?                 70
  O weak Maria! Go to, calm thy fears.
  I pardon thee, poor soul! O shed no tears;
  Thy sex is weak. That black incarnate fiend
  May trip thy faith that hath o'erthrown my life:
  I was impoison'd by Piero's hand.
  Join with my son to bend up strain'd revenge,
  Maintain a seeming favour to his suit,
  Till time may form our vengeance absolute.


  _Enter_ ANTONIO, _his arms bloody, bearing a torch,
  and a poniard_.

  _Ant._ See, unamazed I will behold thy face;
  Outstare the terror of thy grim aspect,                          80
  Daring the horrid'st object of the night.
  Look how I smoke in blood, reeking the steam
  Of foaming vengeance. O my soul's enthroned
  In the triumphant chariot of revenge!
  Methinks I am all air, and feel no weight
  Of human dirt clog. This is Julio's blood!
  Rich music, father: this is Julio's blood!
  Why lives that mother?

  _Ghost of And._ Pardon ignorance.
  Fly, dear Antonio:
  Once more assume disguise, and dog the court                     90
  In feign�d habit, till Piero's blood
  May even o'erflow the brim of full revenge.
  Peace and all bless�d fortunes to you both!
  Fly thou from court, be peerless in revenge:

                                                     [_Exit_ ANTONIO.

  Sleep thou in rest, lo, here I close thy couch.

         [_Exit_ MARIA _to her bed_, ANDRUGIO _drawing the curtains_.

  And now ye sooty coursers of the night,
  Hurry your chariot into hell's black womb.
  Darkness, make flight; graves, eat your dead again:
  Let's repossess our shrouds. Why lags delay?
  Mount sparkling brightness, give the world his day!             100

                                                    [_Exit_ ANDRUGIO.

                              ACT IV.


                              SCENE I.

     _Enter_ ANTONIO _in a fool's habit, with a little toy of a
         walnut shell, and soap to make bubbles_: MARIA _and_
                              ALBERTO.

  _Mar._ Away with this disguise in any hand!

  _Alb._ Fie, 'tis unsuiting to your elate spirit:
  Rather put on some transhaped cavalier,
  Some habit of a spitting critic, whose mouth
  Voids nothing but gentile and unvulgar
  Rheum of censure: rather assume----

  _Ant._ Why, then should I put on the very flesh
  Of solid folly. No, this cock's comb is a crown
  Which I affect even with unbounded zeal.

  _Alb._ 'Twill thwart your plot, disgrace your high resolve.      10

  _Ant._ By wisdom's heart, there is no essence mortal
  That I can envy, but a plump-cheek'd fool:
  O, he hath a patent of immunities
  Confirm'd by custom, seal'd by policy,
  As large as spacious thought.

  _Alb._ You cannot press among the courtiers,
  And have access to----

 _Ant._ What? not a fool? Why, friend, a golden ass,
  A babled[285] fool, are sole canonical,
  Whilst pale-cheek'd wisdom, and lean-ribb�d art                  20
  Are kept in distance at the halbert's point;
  All held Apocrypha, not worth survey.
  Why, by the genius of that Florentine,
  Deep, deep observing, sound-brain'd Machiavel,
  He is not wise that strives not to seem fool.
  When will the Duke hold fee'd intelligence,
  Keep wary observation in large pay,
  To dog a fool's act?

  _Mar._ Ay, but feigning known disgraceth much.

  _Ant._ Pish! Most things that morally adhere to souls,           30
  Wholly exist in drunk opinion:
  Whose reeling censure, if I value not,
  It values nought.

  _Mar._ You are transported with too slight a thought,
  If you but meditate of what is past,
  And what you plot to pass.

  _Ant._ Even in that note a fool's beatitude:
  He is not capable of passion;
  Wanting the power of distinction,
  He bears an unturned sail with every wind:                       40
  Blow east, blow west, he stirs his course alike.
  I never saw a fool lean: the chub-faced fop
  Shines sleek with full-cramm'd fat of happiness,
  Whilst studious contemplation sucks the juice
  From wisards'[286] cheeks: who making curious search
  For nature's secrets, the first innating cause
  Laughs them to scorn, as man doth busy apes
  When they will zany men. Had Heaven been kind,
  Creating me an honest senseless dolt,
  A good poor fool, I should want sense to feel                    50
  The stings of anguish shoot through every vein;
  I should not know what 'twere to lose a father;
  I should be dead of sense to view defame
  Blur my bright love; I could not thus run mad,
  As one confounded in a maze of mischief,
  Stagger'd, stark, fell'd with bruising stroke of chance;
  I should not shoot mine eyes into the earth,
  Poring for mischief that might counterpoise
  Mischief, murder and----

                            _Enter_ LUCIO.

                          How now, Lucio?

  _Lu._ My lord, the Duke, with the Venetian states,[287]          60
  Approach the great hall to judge Mellida.

  _Ant._ Ask'd he for Julio yet?

  _Lu._ No motion[288] of him: dare you trust this habit?

  _Ant._ Alberto, see you straight rumour me dead.
  Leave me, good mother; leave me, Lucio;
  Forsake me, all.

                                     [_Exeunt omnes, saving_ ANTONIO.

                   Now patience hoop my sides
  With steel�d ribs, lest I do burst my breast
  With struggling passions. Now disguise, stand bold:
  Poor scorn�d habits oft choice souls enfold.

                                        [_The cornets sound a senet._

        _Enter_ CASTILIO, FOROBOSCO, BALURDO, _and_ ALBERTO,
      _with pole-axes_, LUCIO _bare; followed by_ PIERO _and_
          MARIA _talking together; two_ Senators, GALEATZO,
                     MATZAGENTE, _and_ NUTRICHE.

  _Pier._ Entreat me not: there's not a beauty lives               70
  Hath that imperial predominance
  O'er my affects[289] as your enchanting graces:
  Yet give me leave to be myself--

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] A villain.

  _Pier._ Just--

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] Most just.

  _Pier._ Most just and upright in our judgment seat.
  Were Mellida mine eye, with such a blemish
  Of most loath'd looseness, I would scratch it out.
  Produce the strumpet in her bridal robes,
  That she may blush t'appear so white in show,                    80
  And black in inward substance. Bring her in.

                                  [_Exeunt_ FOROBOSCO _and_ CASTILIO.

  I hold Antonio, for his father's sake,
  So very dearly, so entirely choice,
  That knew I but a thought of prejudice
  Imagined 'gainst his high ennobled blood,
  I would maintain a mortal feud, undying hate,
  'Gainst the conceiver's life. And shall justice sleep
  In fleshly lethargy, for mine own blood's favour,
  When the sweet prince hath so apparent scorn
  By my--I will not call her daughter? Go,                         90
  Conduct in the loved youth Antonio:

                                  [_Exit_ ALBERTO _to fetch_ ANTONIO.

  He shall behold me spurn my private good;
  Piero loves his honour more than 's blood.

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] The devil he does more than both.

  _Bal._ Stand back there, fool; I do hate a fool most,
  most pathetically. O, these that have no sap of retort
  and obtuse wit in them: faugh!

  _Ant._ Puff, hold, world; puff, hold, bubble; puff, hold,
  world; puff, break not behind; puff, thou art full of
  wind; puff, keep up thy[290] wind; puff, 'tis broke! and
  now I laugh like a good fool at the breath of mine own
  lips, he, he, he, he, he!                                       102

  _Bal._ You fool!

  _Ant._ You fool, puff!

  _Bal._ I cannot disgest[291] thee, the unvulgar fool. Go,
  fool.

  _Pier._ Forbear, Balurdo; let the fool alone.
  Come hither.[292] Is he your fool?

  _Mar._ Yes, my loved lord.

  _Pier._ [_Aside._] Would all the states[293] in Venice were
     like thee!
  O then I were secur'd.                                          110
  He that's a villain, or but meanly soul'd,
  Must still converse and cling to routs of fools,
  That can not search the leaks of his defects.
  O, your unsalted fresh fool is your only man:
  These vinegar tart spirits are too piercing,
  Too searching in the unglued joints of shaken wits.
  Find they a chink, they'll wriggle in and in,
  And eat like salt sea in his siddow[294] ribs,
  Till they have opened all his rotten parts
  Unto the vaunting surge of base contempt,                       120
  And sunk the toss�d galleasse[295] in depth
  Of whirlpool scorn. Give me an honest fop.--
  Dud a dud a! Why lo, sir, this takes he
  As grateful now as a monopoly.

                                    [_The still flutes sound softly._

       _Enter_ FOROBOSCO _and_ CASTILIO: MELLIDA _supported by
                        two waiting-women_.

  _Mel._ All honour to this royal confluence.

  _Pier._ Forbear, impure, to blot bright honour's name
  With thy defil�d lips. The flux of sin
  Flows from thy tainted body: thou so foul,
  So all dishonour'd, canst no honour give,
  No wish of good, that can have good effect                      130
  To this grave senate, and illustrate bloods.
  Why stays the doom of death?

  _1st. Sen._ Who riseth up to manifest her guilt?

  _2d Sen._ You must produce apparent proof, my lord.

  _Pier._ Why, where is Strotzo?--he that swore he saw
  The very act, and vow'd that Feliche fled
  Upon his sight: on which I brake the breast
  Of the adulterous lecher with five stabs.
  Go, fetch in Strotzo. Now, thou impudent,
  If thou hast any drop of modest blood                           140
  Shrouded within thy cheeks, blush, blush for shame,
  That rumour yet may say thou felt'st defame.

  _Mel._ Produce the devil; let your Strotzo come:
  I can defeat his strongest argument,
  With----

  _Pier._ With what?

  _Mel._ With tears, with blushes, sighs, and clasp�d hands;
  With innocent uprear�d arms to Heaven;
  With my unnookt[296] simplicity. These, these
  Must, will, can only quit my heart of guilt:                    150
  Heaven permits not taintless blood be spilt.
  If no remorse live in your savage breast----

  _Pier._ Then thou must die.

  _Mel._ Yet dying, I'll be blest.

  _Pier._ Accurst by me.

  _Mel._ Yet blest, in that I strove
  To live, and die----

  _Pier._ My hate.

  _Mel._ Antonio's love.

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] Antonio's love!

          _Enter_ STROTZO, _with a cord about his neck_.

  _Str._ O what vast ocean of repentant tears
  Can cleanse my breast from the polluting filth
  Of ulcerous sin! Supreme Efficient,
  Why cleavest thou not my breast with thunderbolts               160
  Of wing'd revenge?

  _Pier._ What means this passion?

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] What villainy are they decocting now? Umh!

  _Str. In[297] me convertite ferrum, O proceres.
  Nihil iste, nec ista._

  _Pier._ Lay hold on him!  What strange portent is this?

  _Str._ I will not flinch. Death, hell more grimly stare
  Within my heart than in your threatening brows.
  Record, thou threefold guard of dreadest power,[298]
  What I here speak is forc�d from my lips
  By the [im]pulsive strain of conscience.                        170
  I have a mount of mischief clogs my soul,
  As weighty as the high-noll'd[299] Apennine,
  Which I must straight disgorge, or breast will burst.
  I have defam'd this lady wrongfully,
  By instigation of Antonio,
  Whose reeling love, tost on each fancy's surge,
  Began to loath before it fully joyed.

  _Pier._ Go, seize Antonio! guard him strongly in!

                                                   [_Exit_ FOROBOSCO.

  _Str._ By his ambition being only bribed,
  Fee'd by his impious hand, I poison�d                           180
  His ag�d father, that his thirsty hope[s]
  Might quench their dropsy of aspiring drought
  With full unbounded quaff.

  _Pier._ Seize me, Antonio!

  _Str._ O, why permit you now such scum of filth
  As Strotzo is to live and taint the air
  With his infectious breath!

  _Pier._ Myself will be thy strangler, unmatched slave.

     PIERO _comes from his chair, snatcheth the cord's end, and_
            CASTILIO _aideth him: both strangle_ STROTZO.

  _Str._ Now change your----

  _Pier._ I--pluck Castilio!--I change my humour: pluck Castilio!
  Die, with thy death's entreats even in thy jaws.--              190
  [_Aside._] Now, now, now, now, now, my plot begins to work!
  Why, thus should statesmen do,
  That cleave through knots of craggy policies,
  Use men like wedges, one strike out another,
  Till by degrees the tough and knurly[300] trunk
  Be riv'd in sunder.--Where's Antonio?

                    _Enter_ ALBERTO, _running_.

  _Alb._ O, black accurs�d fate! Antonio's drown'd.

  _Pier._ Speak, on thy faith, on thy allegiance, speak.

  _Alb._ As I do love Piero, he is drown'd.

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] In an inundation of amazement.                200

  _Mel._ Ay, is this the close of all my strains in love?
  O me most wretched maid!

  _Pier._ Antonio drown'd! how? how? Antonio drown'd!

  _Alb._ Distraught and raving, from a turret's top
  He threw his body in the swollen sea,
  And as he headlong topsy turvy ding'd[301] down,
  He still cried "Mellida!"

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] My love's bright crown!

  _Mel._ He still cried "Mellida"!

  _Pier._ Daughter, methinks your eyes should sparkle joy,
  Your bosom rise on tiptoe at this news.                         210

  _Mel._ Ay me!

  _Pier._ How now? Ay, me! why, art not great of thanks
  To gracious Heaven for the just revenge
  Upon the author of thy obloquies!

  _Mar._ Sweet beauty, I could sigh as fast as you,
  But that I know that, which I weep to know.
  [_Aside._] His[302] fortunes should be such he dare not show
  His open presence!

  _Mel._ I know he lov'd me dearly, dearly, ay:
  And since I cannot live with him, I die.             [_Swoons._ 220

  _Pier._ 'Fore Heaven, her speech falters; look, she swouns.
  Convey her up into her private bed.

            [MARIA, NUTRICHE, _and the Ladies bear out_
                    MELLIDA, _as being swooned_.

  I hope she'll live. If not----

  _Ant._ Antonio's dead! the fool will follow too.
  He, he, he!
  [_Aside._] Now works the scene; quick observation, scud
  To cote[303] the plot, or else the path is lost:
  My very self am gone, my way is fled:
  Ay, all is lost, if Mellida is dead.

                                                     [_Exit_ ANTONIO.

  _Pier._ Alberto, I am kind; Alberto, kind.                      230
  I am sorry for thy coz, i'faith I am.
  Go, take him down, and bear him to his father.
  Let him be buried; look ye, I'll pay the priest.

  _Alb._ Please you to admit his father to the court?

  _Pier._ No.

  _Alb._ Please you to restore his lands and goods again?

  _Pier._ No.

  _Alb._ Please you vouchsafe him lodging in the city?

  _Pier._ God's fut, no, thou odd uncivil fellow!
  I think you do forget, sir, where you are.                      240

  _Alb._ I know you do forget, sir, where you must be.

  _Foro._ You are too malapert, i'faith you are.
  Your honour might do well to----

  _Alb._ Peace, parasite; thou bur, that only sticks
  Unto the nap of greatness.

  _Pier._ Away with that same yelping cur--away!

  _Alb._ I--I am gone; but mark, Piero, this.
  There is a thing call'd scourging _Nemesis_.[304]

                                                     [_Exit_ ALBERTO.

  _Bal._ God's neaks, he has wrong, that he has: and
  s'fut, and I were as he, I would bear no coals.[305] Law, I,
  I begin to swell--puff.                                         251

  _Pier._ How now, fool, fop, fool!

  _Bal._[306] Fool, fop, fool! Marry muffe![307] I pray you,
  how many fools have you seen go in a suit of satin? I
  hope, yet, I do not look a fool i'faith! a fool! God's
  bores, I scorn't with my heel. 'S neaks, and I were
  worth but three hundred pound a year more, I could
  swear richly; nay, but as poor as I am, I will swear
  the fellow hath wrong.

  _Pier._ Young Galeatzo! Ay, a proper man;                       260
  Florence, a goodly city: it shall be so,
  I'll marry her to him instantly.
  Then Genoa mine, by my Maria's match,
  Which I'll solemnise ere next setting sun:
  Thus Venice, Florence, Genoa, strongly leagued.
  Excellent, excellent! I'll conquer Rome,
  Pop out the light of bright religion;
  And then, helter skelter, all cock-sure.

  _Bal._ Go to, 'tis just, the man hath wrong: go to.

  _Pier._ Go to, thou shall have right. Go to, Castilio,
  Clap him into the palace dungeon;                               271
  Lap him in rags, and let him feed on slime
  That smears the dungeon' cheek. Away with him.

  _Bal._ In very good truth, now, I'll ne'er do so more;
  this one time and----

  _Pier._ Away with him--observe it strictly--go!

  _Bal._ Why then, O wight!
  Alas, poor knight!
  O, welladay,
  Sir Jefferay!                                                   280
  Let poets roar,
  And all deplore;
  For now I bid you good-night.

                                     [_Exit_ BALURDO _with_ CASTILIO.

                         _Re-enter_ MARIA.

  _Mar._ O piteous end of love! O too, too rude hand
  Of unrespective death! Alas, sweet maid!

  _Pier._ Forbear me, Heaven.  What intend these plaints?

  _Mar._ The beauty of admired creation,
  The life of modest unmix'd purity,
  Our sex's glory, Mellida is----

  _Pier._ What, O Heaven, what!

  _Mar._ Dead!                                                    290

  _Pier._ May it not sad your thoughts, how?

  _Mar._ Being laid upon her bed, she grasp'd my hand,
  And kissing it, spake thus: "Thou very poor,
  Why dost not weep? The jewel of thy brow,
  The rich adornment that enchased thy breast,
  Is lost: thy son, my love, is lost, is dead.
  And do I live to say Antonio's dead?
  And have I lived to see his virtues blurr'd
  With guiltless blots? O world, thou art too subtle
  For honest natures to converse withal,                          300
  Therefore I'll leave thee; farewell, mart of woe,
  I fly to clip my love, Antonio!"
  With that her head sunk down upon her breast;
  Her cheek changed earth, her senses slept in rest,
  Until my fool, that press'd unto the bed,
  Screech'd out so loud that he brought back her soul,
  Call'd her again, that her bright eyes gan ope,
  And stared upon him. He, audacious fool,
  Dared kiss her hand, wish'd her "soft rest, loved bride;"
  She fumbled out, "thanks, good;" and so she died.               310

  _Pier._ And so she died! I do not use to weep;
  But by thy love (out of whose fertile sweet
  I hope for as fair fruit) I am deep sad.--
  I will not stay my marriage for all this.--
  Castilio, Forobosco, all,
  Strain all your wits, wind up invention
  Unto his highest bent, to sweet this night;
  Make us drink Lethe by your quaint conceits,
  That for two days oblivion smother grief.
  But when my daughter's exequies approach,                       320
  Let's all turn sighers. Come, despite of fate,
  Sound loudest music, let's pace out in state!

                                       [_The cornets sound.--Exeunt._


     [285] "Bable" was the old form of "bauble."

     [286] "Wisards" = wise men. In the _Ode on the Nativity_
     Milton styles the wise men from the East _wisards_:--
          "The star-led _wisards_ hasten with odours sweet."

     [287] Nobles.

     [288] _I.e._, there has been no question asked about him.

     [289] Affections.

     [290] Old eds. "by."

     [291] Old form of _digest_.

     [292] Old eds. "Come hither (_ficto_)." The bracketed word is, I
     suppose, a direction to the actor; Piero is to talk in an
     affected voice to Antonio,--treat him as a simpleton.

     [293] Nobles.

     [294] "The word _siddow_ is of very unusual occurrence in early
     English, but it is preserved in the provincial dialect of the
     West of England. In Gloucestershire peas which become pulpy soft
     by boiling are then said to be _siddow_."--_Halliwell._

     [295] Large galleon.

     [296] "_Unnookt_ simplicity" (if the reading is right) must mean
     "simplicity in which no guile is hidden."

     [297] A mangled quotation from _�n._ ix. 427-8.

     [298] The "threefold guard of dreadest power" is, I suppose,

     Hecate."

     [299] High-peaked.--_Nol_ = head, top.

     [300] Full of _knurs_, _i.e._ knotted, gnarled.

     [301] Dashed violently.--We have had the word before (p. 11) used
     transitively; but it is also used intransitively, as in Drayton's
     _Ballad of Agincourt_:--
               "This while our noble king,
               His broadsword brandishing.
               Down the French host did _ding_
                 As to o'erwhelm it." (Text of ed. 1619.)

     [302] _I.e._ alas, that his fortunes should be, &c.

     [303] Cote (another form of _quote_) = mark, note.

     [304] So Hieronymo in _The Spanish Tragedy_:--
              "Well heaven is heaven still!
               And there is Nemesis and furies,
               And things call'd whips."

                             SCENE II.

             _Enter_ ANTONIO _solus, in fool's habit_.

  _Ant._ Ay, heaven, thou may'st, thou may'st, omnipotence.
  What vermin bred of putrefacted slime
  Shall dare to expostulate with thy decrees!
  O heaven, thou may'st indeed: she was all thine,
  All heavenly: I did but humbly beg
  To borrow her of thee a little time.
  Thou gavest her me, as some weak-breasted dame
  Giveth her infant, puts it out to nurse;
  And when it once goes high-lone,[308] takes it back.
  She was my vital blood, and yet, and yet,                        10
  I'll not blaspheme. Look here! behold!

            [ANTONIO _puts off his cap and lieth just upon his back_.

  I turn my prostrate breast upon thy face,
  And vent a heaving sigh. O hear but this!
  I am a poor, poor orphant--a weak, weak child,--
  The wrack of splitted fortune, the very ooze,
  The quicksand that devours all misery.
  Behold the valiant'st creature that doth breathe!
  For all this I dare live, and I will live,
  Only to numb some other's curs�d blood
  With the dead palsy of like misery.                              20
  Then, death, like to a stifling incubus,[309]
  Lie on my bosom. Lo, see,[310] I am sped.
  My breast is Golgotha, grave for the dead.

          _Enter_ PANDULPHO, ALBERTO, _and a Page, carrying_
            FELICHE'S _trunk in a winding sheet, and lay it
                    thwart_ ANTONIO'S _breast_.

  _Pan._ Antonio, kiss my foot: I honour thee,
  In laying thwart my blood upon thy breast.
  I tell thee, boy, he was Pandulpho's son;
  And I do grace thee with supporting him.
  Young man,
  He[311] who hath naught that fortune's gripe can seize,
  The domineering monarch of the earth;                            30
  He who is all impregnably his own,
  He whose great heart heaven cannot force with force,
  Vouchsafes his love. _Non servio Deo, sed assentio._

  _Ant._ I ha' lost a good wife.

  _Pan._ Didst find her good, or didst thou make her good?
  If found, thou may'st refind, because thou hadst her;
  If made, the work is lost, but thou that madest her
  Livest yet as cunning. Hast lost a good wife?
  Thrice-bless�d man that lost her whilst she was good,
  Fair, young, unblemish'd, constant, loving, chaste.              40
  I tell thee, youth, age knows, young loves seem graced,
  Which with gray cares, rude jars, are oft defaced.

  _Ant._ But she was full of hope.

  _Pan._ May be, may be; but that which _may be_ stood,
  Stands now without all _may_. She di�d good,
  And dost thou grieve?

  _Alb._ I ha' lost a true friend.

  _Pan._ I live encompass'd with two bless�d souls.
  Thou lost a good wife, thou lost a true friend, ha!
  Two of the rarest lendings of the heavens,--
  But lendings which, at the fix'd day of pay                      50
  Set down by fate, thou must restore again.[312]
  O what unconscionable souls are here!
  Are you all like the spoke-shaves of the church?
  Have you no maw to restitution?
  Hast lost a true friend, coz? then thou hadst one.
  I tell thee, youth, 'tis all as difficult
  To find true friend in this apostate age
  (That balks all right affiance 'twixt two hearts)
  As 'tis to find a fix�d modest heart
  Under a painted breast. Lost a true friend!                      60
  O happy soul that lost him whilst he was true!
  Believe it, coz, I to my tears have found,
  Oft dirt's respect makes firmer friends unsound.

  _Alb._ You have lost a good son.

  _Pan._ Why, there's the comfort on't, that he was good.
  Alas, poor innocent!

  _Alb._ Why weeps mine uncle?

  _Pan._ Ha, dost ask me why? ha, ha!
  Good coz, look here!              [_He shows him his son's breast._
  Man will break out, despite philosophy.
  Why, all this while I ha' but played a part,                     70
  Like to some boy that acts a tragedy,
  Speaks burly words, and raves out passion;
  But, when he thinks upon his infant weakness,
  He droops his eye. I spake more than a god,
  Yet am less than a man.
  I am the miserablest soul that breathes.

                                                [ANTONIO _starts up_.

  _Ant._ 'Slid, sir, ye lie! by the heart of grief, thou liest!
  I scorn'd that any wretched should survive,
  Outmounting me in that superlative,
  Most miserable, most unmatch'd in woe.                           80
  Who dare assume that but Antonio?

  _Pan._ Wilt still be so, and shall yon blood-hound live?

  _Ant._ Have I an arm, a heart, a sword, a soul?

  _Alb._ Were you but private unto what we know----

  _Pan._ I'll know it all; first let's inter the dead.
  Let's dig his grave with that shall dig the heart,
  Liver, and entrails of the murderer.

                      [_They strike the stage with their daggers, and
                           the grave openeth._

  _Ant._ Wilt sing a dirge, boy?

  _Pan._ No, no song; 'twill be vile out of tune.

  _Alb._ Indeed, he's hoarse; the poor boy's voice is crack'd.     90

  _Pan._ Why, coz! why should it not be hoarse and crack'd,
  When all the strings of nature's symphony
  Are crack'd and jar? Why should his voice keep tune,
  When there's no music in the breast of man?
  I'll say an honest antic rhyme I have:
  Help me, good sorrow-mates, to give him grave.

                    [_They all help to carry_ FELICHE _to his grave_.

  Death, exile, plaints, and woe,
  Are but man's lackeys, not his foe.
  No mortal 'scapes from fortune's war
  Without a wound, at least a scar.                               100
  Many have led thee[313] to the grave;
  But all shall follow, none shall save.
  Blood of my youth, rot and consume;
  Virtue in dirt doth life assume.
  With this old saw close up this dust:--
  Thrice bless�d man that dieth just.

  _Ant._ The gloomy wing of night begins to stretch
  His lazy pinion o'er the air.
  We must be stiff and steady in resolve;
  Let's thus our hands, our hearts, our arms involve.             110

                                           [_They wreath their arms._

  _Pan._ Now swear we by this Gordian knot of love,
  By the fresh-turned up mould that wraps my son,
  By the d[r]ead brow of triple Hecate,
  Ere night shall close the lids of yon bright stars,
  We'll sit as heavy on Piero's heart,
  As �tna doth on groaning Pelorus.

  _Ant._ Thanks, good old man; we'll cast at royal chance.
  Let's think a plot--then pell-mell, vengeance!

                                      [_Exeunt, their arms wreathed._

                              ACT V.


                             SCENE I.

                  _The cornets sound for the Act._

                         _The dumb show._

  _Enter at one door_ CASTILIO _and_ FOROBOSCO, _with halberts; four
  Pages with torches_; LUCIO, _bare_; PIERO, MARIA, _and_ ALBERTO,
  _talking_; ALBERTO _draws out his dagger_, MARIA _her knife, aiming
  to menace the Duke. Then_ GALEATZO, _betwixt two Senators, reading a
  paper to them, at which they all make semblance of loathing_ PIERO,
  _and knit their fists at him; two Ladies and_ NUTRICHE. _All these
  go softly over the stage, whilst at the other door enters the ghost
  of_ ANDRUGIO, _who passeth by them, tossing his torch about his head
  in triumph. All forsake the stage, saving_ ANDRUGIO, _who, speaking,
  begins the Act_.

  _Ghost of And. Venit dies, tempusque, quo reddat suis Animam
  squalentem sceleribus._

  The[314] fist of strenuous vengeance is clutch'd,
  And stern Vindicta tow'reth up aloft,
  That she may fall with a more weighty paise,
  And crush life's sap from out Piero's veins.
  Now 'gins the leprous cores of ulcered sins
  Wheel to a head; now is his fate grown mellow,
  Instant to fall into the rotten jaws
  Of chap-fall'n death. Now down looks Providence,                 10
  T'attend the last act of my son's revenge.
  Be gracious, observation, to our scene,
  For now the plot unites his scatter'd limbs
  Close in contracted bands. The Florence Prince
  (Drawn by firm notice of the Duke's black deeds)
  Is made a partner in conspiracy.
  The states of Venice are so swoll'n in hate
  Against the Duke for his accurs�d deeds
  (Of which they are confirm'd by some odd letters
  Found in dead Strotzo's study, which had past                    20
  Betwixt Piero and the murd'ring slave)
  That they can scarce retain from bursting forth
  In plain revolt. O, now triumphs my ghost,
  Exclaiming, Heaven's just, for I shall see
  The scourge of murder and impiety!

                                                             [_Exit._


     [314] This line is ridiculed in _The Poetaster_, v. 1:--
                        "Break his back,
           O poets all and some! for now we list
          _Of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist_."


                             SCENE I.

                  BALURDO _from under the Stage_.

  _Bal._ Ho, who's above there, ho? A murrain on all
  proverbs. They say hunger breaks through stone walls;
  but I am as gaunt as lean-ribb'd famine, yet I can burst
  through no stone walls. O now, Sir Jeffrey, show thy
  valour, break prison and be hang'd. Nor shall the
  darkest nook of hell contain the discontented Sir
  Balurdo's ghost. Well, I am out well; I have put
  off the prison to put on the rope. O poor shotten
  herring, what a pickle art thou in! O hunger, how thou
  domineer'st in my guts! O for a fat leg of ewe mutton
  in stewed broth, or drunken song to feed on! I could
  belch rarely, for I am all wind. O cold, cold, cold,
  cold, cold! O poor knight! O poor Sir Jeffrey, sing
  like an unicorn before thou dost dip thy horn in the
  water of death. O cold, O sing, O cold, O poor
  Sir Jeffrey, sing, sing!                                         16

                                                           [_A song._

        _Enter_ ANTONIO _and_ Alberto _at several doors, their
               rapiers drawn, in their masking attire_.

  _Ant._ Vindicta!

  _Alb._ Mellida!

  _Ant._ Alberto!

  _Alb._ Antonio!

  _Ant._ Hath the Duke supp'd?

  _Alb._ Yes, and triumphant revels mount aloft.
  The Duke drinks deep to overflow his grief;
  The court is rack'd to pleasure; each man strains
  To feign a jocund eye. The Florentine----

  _Ant._ Young Galeatzo!

  _Alb._ Even he is mighty on our part. The states of Venice----

         _Enter_ PANDULPHO, _running, in masking attire_.

  _Pan._ Like high-swoll'n floods drive down the muddy dams
  Of pent allegiance. O, my lusty bloods,
  Heaven sits clapping of our enterprise.                          30
  I have been labouring general favour firm,
  And I do find the citizens grown sick
  With swallowing the bloody crudities
  Of black Piero's acts; they fain would cast
  And vomit him from off their government.
  Now is the plot of mischief ript wide ope;
  Letters are found 'twixt Strotzo and the Duke,
  So clear apparent, yet more firmly strong
  By suiting circumstance, that, as I walk'd,
  Muffled, to eavesdrop speech, I might observe                    40
  The graver statesmen whispering fearfully.
  Here one gives nods and hums what he would speak;
  The rumour's got 'mong troop of citizens,
  Making loud murmur, with confus�d din;
  One shakes his head and sighs, "O ill-used power!"
  Another frets, and sets his grinding teeth,
  Foaming with rage, and swears this must not be;
  Here one complots, and on a sudden starts,
  And cries, O monstrous, O deep villainy!
  All knit their nerves, and from beneath swoll'n brows            50
  Appears a gloating eye of much mislike;
  Whilst swart Piero's lips reak steam of wine,
  Swallows lust-thoughts, devours all pleasing hopes,
  With strong imagination of--what not?
  O now Vindicta! that's the word we have,
  A royal vengeance, or a royal grave!

  _Ant._ Vindicta!

  _Bal._ [_From beneath the stage._] I am acold.

  _Pan._ Who's there? Sir Jeffrey?

  _Bal._ A poor knight, god wot: the nose of thy knighthood
  is bitten off with cold. O poor Sir Jeffrey, cold,
  cold!                                                            62

  _Pan._ What chance of fortune hath tripp'd up his heels,
  And laid him in the kennel, ha?

  _Alb._ I will discourse it all. Poor honest soul,
  Hadst thou a beaver to clasp up thy face,
  Thou should'st associate us in masquery,
  And see revenge.

  _Bal._ Nay, and you talk of revenge, my stomach's up,
  for I am most tyrannically hungry. A beaver! I have
  a headpiece, a skull, a brain of proof, I warrant ye.            71

  _Alb._ Slink to my chamber then, and tire thee.

  _Bal._ Is there a fire?

  _Alb._ Yes.

  _Bal._ Is there a fat leg of ewe mutton?

  _Alb._ Yes.

  _Bal._ And a clean shirt?

  _Alb._ Yes.

  _Bal._ Then am I for you, most pathetically, and unvulgarly,
  law!                                                             80

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Ant._ Resolved hearts, time curtails night, opportunity
  shakes us his foretop. Steel your thoughts, sharp your
  resolve, embolden your spirit, grasp your swords; alarum
  mischief, and with an undaunted brow, out scout the
  grim opposition of most menacing peril.

  Hark! here proud pomp shoots mounting triumph up,
  Borne in loud accents to the front of Jove.

  _Pan._ O now, he that wants soul to kill a slave,
  Let him die slave, and rot in peasant's grave.

  _Ant._ Give me thy hand, and thine, most noble heart;
  Thus will we live, and, but thus, never part.                    91

                                          [_Exeunt, twined together._

                      _Cornets sound a senet._


                             SCENE II.

                       _A Banqueting-hall._

     _Enter_ CASTILIO _and_ FOROBOSCO; _two Pages, with torches_;
          LUCIO, _bare_; PIERO _and_ MARIA, GALEATZO, _two
                      Senators, and_ NUTRICHE.

  _Pier._ Sit close unto my breast, heart of my love;
  Advance thy drooping eyes, thy son is drown'd.
  Rich happiness that such a son is drown'd!
  Thy husband's dead: life of my joys most bless'd,
  In that the sapless log, that press'd thy bed
  With an unpleasing weight, being lifted hence,
  Even I, Piero, live to warm his place.
  I tell you, lady, had you view'd us both
  With an unpartial eye, when first we wooed
  Your maiden beauties, I had borne the prize.                     10
  'Tis firm I had; for, fair, I ha' done that----

  _Mar._ [_Aside._] Murder.

  _Pier._ Which he would quake to have adventur�d;
  Thou know'st I have----

  _Mar._ [_Aside._] Murder'd my husband.

  _Pier._ Borne out the shock of war, and done--what not,
  That valour durst? Dost love me, fairest? Say.

  _Mar._ As I do hate my son, I love thy soul.

  _Pier._ Why, then, Io[315] to Hymen, mount a lofty note!
  Fill[316] red-cheek'd Bacchus, let Ly�us float                   20
  In burnish'd goblets! Force the plump-lipp'd god.
  Skip light lavoltas[317] in your full-sapp'd veins!
  'Tis well, brim full. Even I have glut of blood:
  Let quaff carouse. I drink this Burdeaux wine
  Unto the health of dead Andrugio,
  Feliche, Strotzo, and Antonio's ghosts.
  [_Aside._] Would I had some poison to infuse it with;
  That having done this honour to the dead,
  I might send one to give them notice on't:
  I would endear my favour to the full.--                          30
  Boy, sing aloud; make heaven's vault to ring
  With thy breath's strength. I drink. Now loudly sing.

                 [_A song. The song ended the cornets sound a senet._

      _Enter_ ANTONIO, PANDULPHO, _and_ ALBERTO, _in maskery_;
                   BALURDO, _and a Torchbearer_.

  _Pier._ Call Julio hither. Where's the little soul?
  I saw him not to-day. Here's sport alone
  For him, i'faith; for babes and fools, I know,
  Relish not substance, but applaud the show.

  _Gal._ (_To the conspirators as they stand in rank for the
          measure._[318]) All bless�d fortune crown your brave
          attempt.                                     [_To_ ANTONIO.
  I have a troop to second your attempt.             [_To_ PANDULPHO.
  The Venice states join hearts unto your hands.       [_To_ ALBERTO.

  _Pier._ By the delights in contemplation                         40
  Of coming joys, 'tis magnificent.
  You grace my marriage eve with sumptuous pomp.
  Sound still, loud music! O, your breath gives grace
  To curious feet, that in proud measure pace.

  _Ant._ [_Aside to_ MARIA.] Mother, is Julio's body----

  _Mar._ [_Aside to_ ANTONIO.] Speak not, doubt not; all is
          above all hope.

  _Ant._ [_Aside._] Then will I dance and whirl about the air:
  Methinks I am all soul, all heart, all spirit.
  Now murder shall receive his ample merit.

                          _The measure._

  _While the measure is dancing_, ANDRUGIO'S _ghost is placed
                  betwixt the music-houses_.[319]

  _Pier._ Bring hither suckets, candied delicates.                 50
  We'll taste some sweetmeats, gallants, ere we sleep.

  _Ant._--We'll cook your sweetmeats, gallants, with tart sour sauce.

  _Ghost of And._ Here will I sit, spectator of revenge,
  And glad my ghost in anguish of my foe.

                                   [_The maskers whisper with_ PIERO.

  _Pier._ Marry and shall; i'faith I were too rude,
  If I gainsaid so civil fashion.--
  The maskers pray you to forbear the room
  Till they have banqueted. Let it be so:
  No man presume to visit them, on death.

                                        [_The maskers whisper again._

  Only my self? O, why, with all my heart;                         60

                           [_Exeunt all but_ PIERO _and the maskers_.

  I'll fill your consort. Here Piero sits;
  Come on, unmask, let's fall to.

               [_The conspirators bind_ PIERO, _pluck out his tongue,
                    and triumph over him_.

  _Ant._ Murder and torture! no prayers, no entreats!

  _Pan._ We'll spoil your oratory. Out with his tongue.

  _Ant._ I have 't, Pandulpho; the veins panting bleed,
  Trickling fresh gore about my fist. Bind fast--so, so!

  _Ghost of And._ Bless'd be thy hand! I taste the joys of heaven,
  Viewing my son triumph in his black blood.

  _Bal._ Down to the dungeon with him! I'll dungeon
  with him! I'll fool you; Sir Jeffrey will be Sir Jeffrey;
  I'll tickle you.                                                 71

  _Ant._ Behold, black dog!

  _Pan._ Grinn'st thou, thou snurling[320] cur?

  _Alb._ Eat thy black liver.

  _Ant._ To thine anguish see
  A fool triumphant in thy misery.
  Vex him, Balurdo.

  _Pan._ He weeps; now do I glorify my hands;
  I had no vengeance, if I had no tears.

  _Ant._ Fall to, good Duke. O these are worthless cates,
  You have no stomach to them; look, look here:
  Here lies a dish to feast thy father's gorge.                    80

                [_Uncovering the dish that contains_ LUCIO'S _limbs_.

  Here's flesh and blood, which I am sure thou lov'st.

                                   [PIERO _seems to condole his son_.

  _Pan._ Was he thy flesh, thy son, thy dearest son?

  _Ant._ So was Andrugio, my dearest father.

  _Pan._ So was Feliche, my dearest son.

                          _Enter_ MARIA.

  _Mar._ So was Andrugio my dearest husband.

  _Ant._ My father found no pity in thy blood.

  _Pan._ Remorse was banish'd, when thou slew'st my son.

  _Mar._ When thou empoisoned'st my loving lord,
  Exiled was piety.

  _Ant._ Now therefore pity, piety, remorse,                       90
  Be aliens to our thoughts; grim fire-ey'd rage
  Possess us wholly.

  _Pan._ Thy son? true; and which is my most joy,
  I hope no bastard, but thy very blood,
  Thy true-begotten, most legitimate
  And lov�d issue--there's the comfort on't.

  _Ant._ Scum of the mud of hell!

  _Alb._ Slime of all filth!

  _Mar._ Thou most detested toad!

  _Bal._ Thou most retort and obtuse rascal!

  _Ant._ Thus charge we death at thee; remember hell,
  And let the howling murmurs of black spirits,                   101
  The horrid torments of the damn�d ghosts,
  Affright thy soul as it descendeth down
  Into the entrails of the ugly deep.

  _Pan._ Sa, sa; no, let him die, and die, and still be dying.

           [_They offer to run all at_ PIERO, _and on a sudden stop_.

  And yet not die till he hath died and died
  Ten thousand deaths in agony of heart.

  Ant. Now pellmell: thus the hand of Heaven chokes
  The throat of murder. This for my father's blood!

                                                   [_He stabs_ PIERO.

  _Pan._ This for my son!                                         110

  _Alb._ This for them all!
  And this, and this, sink to the heart of hell!

                       [_They run all at_ PIERO _with their rapiers_.

  _Pan._ Murder for murder, blood for blood, doth yell!

  _And._ 'Tis done, and now my soul shall sleep in rest:
  Sons that revenge their father's blood are blest.

                          [_The curtains being drawn, exit_ ANDRUGIO.

         _Enter_ GALEATZO, _two_ Senators, LUCIO, FOROBOSCO,
                       CASTILIO, _and Ladies_.

  _1st Sen._ Whose hand presents this gory spectacle?

  _Ant._ Mine.

  _Pan._ No, mine.

  _Alb._ No, mine.

  _Ant._ I will not lose the glory of the deed,                   120
  Were all the tortures of the deepest hell
  Fix'd to my limbs. I pierced the monster's heart
  With an undaunted hand.

  _Pan._ By yon bright-spangled front of heaven 'twas I!
  'Twas I sluiced[321] out his life-blood.

  _Alb._ Tush, to say truth, 'twas all.

  _2d Sen._ Blest be you all, and may your honours live
  Religiously held sacred, even for ever and ever.

  _Gal._ (_to_ ANTONIO). Thou art another Hercules to us,
  In ridding huge pollution from our state.                       130

  _1st Sen._ Antonio, belief is fortified
  With most invincible approvements[322] of much wrong
  By this Piero to thee. We have found
  Beadrolls of mischief, plots of villainy,
  Laid 'twixt the Duke and Strotzo, which we found
  Too firmly acted.

  _2d Sen._ Alas, poor orphant!

  _Ant._ Poor!
  Standing triumphant over Belzebub!
  Having large interest for blood, and yet deem'd poor?

  _1st Sen._ What satisfaction outward pomp can yield,
  Or chiefest fortunes of the Venice state,                       140
  Claim freely. You are well-season'd props,
  And will not warp, or lean to either part;
  Calamity gives a man a steady heart.

  _Ant._ We are amaz'd at your benignity;
  But other vows constrain another course.

  _Pan._ We know the world, and did we know no more,
  We would not live to know; but since constraint
  Of holy bands forceth us keep this lodge
  Of dirt's corruption, till dread power calls
  Our soul's appearance, we will live enclosed                    150
  In holy verge of some religious order,
  Most constant votaries.

                        [_The curtains are drawn_, PIERO _departeth_.

  _Ant._ First let's cleanse our hands,
  Purge hearts of hatred, and entomb my love,
  Over whose hearse I'll weep away my brain
  In true affection's tears.
  For her sake here I vow a virgin bed:
  She lives in me, with her my love is dead.

  _2d Sen._ We will attend her mournful exequies;
  Conduct you to your calm sequestered life,
  And then----                                                    160

  _Mar._ Leave us to meditate on misery,
  To sad our thought with contemplation
  Of past calamities. If any ask
  Where lives the widow of the poison'd lord?
  Where lies the orphant of a murder'd father?
  Where lies the father of a butcher'd son?
  Where lives all woe?--conduct him to us three,
  The down-cast ruins of calamity.

  _Ant._[323] Sound doleful tunes, a solemn hymn advance,
  To close the last act of my vengeance;                          170
  And when the subject of your passion's spent,
  Sing _Mellida is dead_; all hearts will relent,
  In sad condolement at that heavy sound.
  Never more woe in lesser plot was found!
  And, O, if ever time create a muse,
  That to th' immortal fame of virgin faith
  Dares once engage his pen to write her death,
  Presenting it in some black tragedy,
  May it prove gracious; may his style be deck'd
  With freshest blooms of purest elegance;
  May it have gentle presence, and the scenes suck'd up
  By calm attention of choice audience;                           181
  And when the closing Epilogue appears,
  Instead of claps, may it obtain but tears.

                        STORY OF THE PLAY.

Giovanni Altofronto, Duke of Genoa, driven from power by the plots of
Pietro Jacomo, disguises himself and lives under the name of Malevole
at the usurper's court, assuming the character of a malcontent. His
identity is known only to his faithful friend Celso. A crafty
courtier, Mendoza, who had assisted in dethroning Altofronto, has
adulterous intercourse with Pietro's wife, Aurelia. Malevole exposes
the intrigue to Pietro; but meanwhile Aurelia, induced by an old
procuress, Maquerelle, to believe that her lover is faithless,
discards Mendoza and engages in an intrigue with another courtier,
Ferneze. Pietro, sword in hand, seeks Mendoza, who makes passionate
protestations of his own innocence, and declares that the guilty
person is Ferneze. On that very night Ferneze has an appointment with
the Duchess; and it is agreed that Pietro with some of the guard shall
break into the Duchess' chamber, while Mendoza waits with his drawn
sword at the door. Ferneze is to be allowed to escape from the
chamber, only to be received on the sword of Mendoza, who is then to
stand over the body and pretend that he is guarding it from assault.
Thus Mendoza will not only serve Pietro, but by his seeming generosity
towards Ferneze will earn the gratitude of Aurelia, who, should she
attempt to take vengeance on her husband, will not fail to make
Mendoza acquainted with her plots, which he will incontinently reveal
to Pietro. At the hour appointed, Pietro and the guard invade the
Duchess' chamber; the flying gallant is stabbed by Mendoza and left
for dead (though he afterwards recovers from the wound); Aurelia
receives Mendoza again into favour, and practises with him to murder
Pietro. Mendoza, selecting a time when Pietro had gone a-hunting,
bribes Malevole to commit the murder. Malevole undertakes to kill
Pietro by stealth in the forest, fling his body into the sea, and then
return to announce that Pietro, distracted by grief at the dishonour
brought on him by his wife, has made away with himself by leaping into
the sea from a high rock. To the forest goes Malevole, finds Pietro,
and exposes to him the plot; presently Celso appears bringing a
hermit's weeds, into which Pietro shifts. They return to the court,
and the pretended hermit describes with much detail how he saw Pietro
perish, the narrative being substantiated by Malevole. Mendoza is
proclaimed Duke, and his first act is to pronounce a sentence of
perpetual banishment on Aurelia. He then commissions Malevole to bring
from the citadel (where she is confined) the wife of the banished
Altofronto, the virtuous Maria, whom he intends to make his Duchess.
His brain is now exercised to procure the destruction of the supposed
murderers. Malevole is instructed to poison the hermit at a supper
given in the citadel, and the hermit on the same occasion is to poison
Malevole; thus two awkward agents will be removed, and the suspicion
will fall on Maria, whose fears will drive her to submit to Mendoza.
Pietro informs Malevole of the instructions he had received, and
learns that similar instructions have been given to Malevole. Weighed
down with sorrow at his own dishonour, and disgusted with Mendoza's
villainy, Pietro declares his determination to dedicate his life to
religious solitude, and make it his one care that the banished
Altofronto shall be restored to the dukedom. Thereupon Malevole puts
off his disguise, and Pietro beholds the banished Duke. Ferneze now
approaches with Celso, and receives pardon from Pietro, who had
supposed him to be dead. The four then take counsel how they shall
depose Mendoza. Malevole goes to the usurper and announces that he has
poisoned the hermit; he then produces a box of poison, which, he
declares, will cause instant death on being opened and held to the
nostrils. Mendoza opens the box and tries its effects on Malevole, who
feigns to fall dead. A masque is ordered by Mendoza to be given in
honour of Maria, who shows herself indifferent both to the tyrant's
flatteries and threats. At the entertainment Malevole, Pietro, and
Ferneze appear masked; Malevole chooses Maria as his partner in the
dance, and Pietro is matched with Aurelia, who has deeply repented of
her misconduct. At the close of the dance, during which Malevole and
Pietro have discovered themselves to their partners, the maskers
environ Mendoza, level their pistols at his head, and unmask.
Altofronto is received with joyful acclamations by the assembled
company, and Mendoza--whose life the restored Duke disdains to
take--is banished with shameful ignominy.

                          TO THE READER.


I am an ill orator; and, in truth, use to indite more honestly than
eloquently, for it is my custom to speak as I think, and write as I
speak.

In plainness, therefore, understand, that in some things I have
willingly erred, as in supposing a Duke of Genoa, and in taking names
different from that city's families: for which some may wittily accuse
me; but my defence shall be as honest as many reproofs unto me have
been most malicious. Since, I heartily protest, it was my care to
write so far from reasonable offence, that even strangers, in whose
state I laid my scene, should not from thence draw any disgrace to
any, dead or living. Yet, in despite of my endeavours, I understand
some have been most unadvisedly over-cunning in misinterpreting me,
and with subtlety as deep as hell have maliciously spread ill rumours,
which, springing from themselves, might to themselves have heavily
returned. Surely I desire to satisfy every firm spirit, who, in all
his actions, proposeth to himself no more ends than God and virtue do,
whose intentions are always simple: to such I protest that, with my
free understanding, I have not glanced at disgrace of any, but of
those whose unquiet studies labour innovation, contempt of holy
policy, reverend, comely superiority, and established unity: for the
rest of my supposed tartness, I fear not but unto every worthy mind it
will be approved so general and honest as may modestly pass with the
freedom of a satire. I would fain leave the paper; only one thing
afflicts me, to think that scenes, invented merely to be spoken,
should be enforcively published to be read, and that the least hurt I
can receive is to do myself the wrong. But, since others otherwise
would do me more, the least inconvenience is to be accepted. I have
myself, therefore, set forth this comedy; but so, that my enforced
absence must much rely upon the printer's discretion: but I shall
entreat slight errors in orthography may be as slightly over-passed,
and that the unhandsome shape which this trifle in reading presents,
may be pardoned for the pleasure it once afforded you when it was
presented with the soul of lively action.

   _Enter_ W. SLY,[327] _a_ Tire-man _following him with a stool_.

  _Tire-man._ Sir, the gentlemen will be angry if you sit
  here.

  _Sly._ Why, we may sit upon the stage at the private
  house.[328] Thou dost not take me for a country gentleman,
  dost? dost think I fear hissing?[329] I'll hold my
  life thou tookest me for one of the players.

  _Tire-man._ No, sir.

  _Sly._ By God's slid, if you had, I would have given you
  but sixpence[330] for your stool. Let them that have stale
  suits sit in the galleries. Hiss at me! He that will be
  laughed out of a tavern or an ordinary, shall seldom feed
  well, or be drunk in good company.--Where's Harry
  Condell, Dick Burbadge, and William Sly? Let me
  speak with some of them.                                         14

  _Tire-man._ An't please you to go in, sir, you may.

  _Sly._ I tell you, no: I am one that hath seen this play
  often, and can give them intelligence for their action: I
  have most of the jests here in my table-book.

                       _Enter_ SINKLO.[331]

  _Sinklo._ Save you, coz!

  _Sly._ O, cousin, come, you shall sit between my legs
  here.                                                            21

  _Sinklo._ No, indeed, cousin: the audience then will
  take me for a viol-de-gambo, and think that you play
  upon me.

  _Sly._ Nay, rather that I work upon you, coz.

  _Sinklo._ We stayed for you at supper last night at my
  cousin Honeymoon's, the woollen-draper. After supper
  we drew cuts for a score of apricocks, the longest cut
  still to draw an apricock: by this light, 'twas Mistress
  Frank Honeymoon's fortune still to have the longest
  cut: I did measure for the women.--What be these,
  coz?                                                             32

       _Enter_ D. BURBADGE,[332] H. CONDELL, _and_ J. LOWIN.

  _Sly._ The players.--God save you!

  _Burbadge._ You are very welcome.

  _Sly._ I pray you, know this gentleman, my cousin;
  'tis Master Doomsday's son, the usurer.

  _Condell._ I beseech you, sir, be covered.

  _Sly._ No,[333] in good faith, for mine ease: look you, my
  hat's the handle to this fan: God's so, what a beast
  was I, I did not leave my feather at home! Well,
  but I'll take an order with you.                                 41

                                   [_Puts his feather in his pocket._

  _Burbadge._ Why do you conceal your feather, sir?

  _Sly._ Why, do you think I'll have jests broken upon
  me in the play, to be laughed at? this play hath beaten
  all your gallants out of the feathers: Blackfriars hath
  almost spoiled Blackfriars for feathers.[334]

  _Sinklo._ God's so, I thought 'twas for somewhat our
  gentlewomen at home counselled me to wear my feather
  to the play: yet I am loth to spoil it.

  _Sly._ Why, coz?                                                 50

  _Sinklo._ Because I got it in the tilt-yard; there was a
  herald broke my pate for taking it up: but I have worn
  it up and down the Strand, and met him forty times
  since, and yet he dares not challenge it.

  _Sly._ Do you hear, sir? this play is a bitter play.

  _Condell._ Why, sir, 'tis neither satire nor moral, but the
  mean passage of a history: yet there are a sort of discontented
  creatures that bear a stingless envy to great
  ones, and these will wrest the doings of any man to their
  base, malicious appliment; but should their interpretation
  come to the test, like your marmoset, they presently
  turn their teeth to their tail and eat it.                       62

  _Sly._ I will not go so far with you; but I say, any
  man that hath wit may censure,[335] if he sit in the twelve-penny
  room;[336] and I say again, the play is bitter.

  _Burbadge._ Sir, you are like a patron that, presenting
  a poor scholar to a benefice, enjoins him not to rail
  against anything that stands within compass of his
  patron's folly. Why should not we enjoy the ancient
  freedom of poesy? Shall we protest to the ladies that
  their painting makes them angels? or to my young
  gallant that his expenses in the brothel shall gain him
  reputation? No, sir, such vices as stand not accountable
  to law should be cured as men heal tetters, by casting
  ink upon them. Would you be satisfied in anything
  else, sir?                                                       76

  _Sly._ Ay, marry, would I: I would know how you
  came by this play?

  _Condell._ Faith, sir, the book was lost; and because
  'twas pity so good a play should be lost, we found it,
  and play it.                                                 81

  _Sly._ I wonder you would play it, another company
  having interest in it.

  _Condell._ Why not Malevole in folio with us, as Jeronimo
  in decimo-sexto[337] with them? They taught us a
  name for our play; we call it _One for another_.

  _Sly._ What are your additions?

  _Burbadge._ Sooth, not greatly needful; only as your
  salad to your great feast, to entertain a little more time,
  and to abridge the not-received custom of music in our
  theatre. I must leave you, sir.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Sinklo._ Doth he play the Malcontent.                           92

  _Condell._ Yes, sir.

  _Sinklo._ I durst lay four of mine ears the play is not so
  well acted as it hath been.

  _Condell._ O, no, sir, nothing _ad Parmenonis suem_.[338]

  _Lowin._ Have you lost your ears, sir, that you are so
  prodigal of laying them?

  _Sinklo._ Why did you ask that, friend?

  _Lowin._ Marry, sir, because I have heard of a fellow
  would offer to lay a hundred-pound wager that was not
  worth five baubees:[339] and in this kind you might venture
  four of your elbows; yet God defend[340] your coat should
  have so many!                                                   104

  _Sinklo._ Nay, truly, I am no great censurer; and yet I
  might have been one of the college of critics once. My
  cousin here hath an excellent memory indeed, sir.

  _Sly._ Who, I? I'll tell you a strange thing of myself;
  and I can tell you, for one that never studied the art of
  memory, 'tis very strange too.                                  110

  _Condell._ What's that, sir?

  _Sly._ Why, I'll lay a hundred pound, I'll walk but once
  down by the Goldsmiths' Row in Cheap, take notice of
  the signs, and tell you them with a breath instantly.

  _Lowin._ 'Tis very strange.

  _Sly._ They begin as the world did, with Adam and
  Eve. There's in all just five and fifty.[341] I do use to
  meditate much when I come to plays too. What do
  you think might come into a man's head now, seeing all
  this company?                                                   120

  _Condell._ I know not, sir.

  _Sly._ I have an excellent thought. If some fifty of the
  Grecians that were crammed in the horse'-belly had
  eaten garlic, do you not think the Trojans might have
  smelt out their knavery?

  _Condell._ Very likely.

  _Sly._ By God, I would they[342] had, for I love Hector
  horribly.

  _Sinklo._ O, but, coz, coz!
  "Great[343] Alexander, when he came to the tomb of Achilles,
  Spake with a big loud voice, O thou thrice bless�d and happy!"  131

  _Sly._ Alexander was an ass to speak so well of a filthy
  cullion.[344]

  _Lowin._ Good sir, will you leave the stage? I'll help
  you to a private room.[345]

  _Sly._ Come, coz, let's take some tobacco.[346]--Have you
  never a prologue?

  _Lowin._ Not any, sir.

  _Sly._ Let me see, I will make one extempore.

               [_Come[347] to them, and fencing of a congey with arms
                    and legs, be round with them._

  Gentlemen,[348] I could wish for the women's sakes you
  had all soft cushions; and, gentlewomen, I could wish
  that for the men's sakes you had all more easy standings.

  What would they wish more but the play now? and
  that they shall have instantly.                                 144

                                                           [_Exeunt._
                              ACT I.


                             SCENE I.

                  _Palace of the Duke of Genoa._

      _The vilest out-of-tune music being heard, enter_ BILIOSO
                          _and_ PREPASSO.

  _Bil._ Why, how now! are ye mad, or drunk, or both,
  or what?

  _Pre._ Are ye building Babylon there?

  _Bil._ Here's a noise in court! you think you are in a
  tavern, do you not?

  _Pre._ You think you are in a brothel-house, do you
  not?--This room is ill-scented.

                    _Enter One with a perfume._

  So, perfume, perfume; some upon me, I pray thee.--
  The duke is upon instant entrance: so, make place there!

           _Enter_ PIETRO, FERRARDO, EQUATO; CELSO _and_
                        GUERRINO _before_.


  _Pietro._ Where breathes that music?                             10

  _Bil._ The discord rather than the music is heard from
  the malcontent Malevole's chamber.

  _Fer._ [_calling_] Malevole!

  _Mal._ [_above, out of his chamber_] Yaugh, god-a-man,
  what dost thou there? Duke's Ganymede, Juno's jealous
  of thy long stockings: shadow of a woman, what wouldst,
  weasel? thou lamb o'court, what dost thou bleat for? ah,
  you smooth-chinned catamite!

  _Pietro._ Come down, thou rugged[350] cur, and snarl here;
  I give thy dogged sullenness free liberty: trot about and
  bespurtle whom thou pleasest.                                    21

  _Mal._ I'll come among you, you goatish-blooded
  toderers,[351] as gum into taffata, to fret, to fret: I'll fall
  like a sponge into water, to suck up, to suck up. [_Howls
  again._[352]] I'll go to church,[353] and come to you.

                                                       [_Exit above._

  _Pietro._ This Malevole is one of the most prodigious
  affections that ever conversed with nature: a man, or
  rather a monster, more discontent than Lucifer when he
  was thrust out of the presence. His appetite is unsatiable
  as the grave; as far from any content as from heaven:
  his highest delight is to procure others' vexation, and
  therein he thinks he truly serves heaven; for 'tis his
  position, whosoever in this earth can be contented is a
  slave and damned; therefore does he afflict all in that
  to which they are most affected. The elements struggle
  within him; his own soul is at variance within herself;[354]
  his speech is halter-worthy at all hours. I like him,
  faith: he gives good intelligence to my spirit, makes me
  understand those weaknesses which others' flattery
  palliates.--Hark! they sing. [_A song._] See, he comes.
  Now shall you hear the extremity of a malcontent: he is
  as free as air; he blows over every man.                         42

                     _Enter_ MALEVOLE _below_.

  And, sir, whence come you now?

  _Mal._ From the public place of much dissimulation,
  the church.[355]

  _Pietro._ What didst there?

  _Mal._ Talk with a usurer; take up at interest.

  _Pietro._ I wonder what religion thou art of?[356]

  _Mal._ Of a soldier's religion.

  _Pietro._ And what dost thou[357] think makes most infidels
  now?                                                             51

  _Mal._ Sects, sects. I have seen seeming piety change
  her robe so oft, that sure none but some arch-devil can
  shape her a new[358] petticoat.

  _Pietro._ O, a religious policy.

  _Mal._ But, damnation on a politic religion! I am
  weary: would I were one of the duke's hounds now![359]

  _Pietro._ But what's the common news abroad, Malevole?
  thou doggest rumour still.                                       59

  _Mal._ Common news! why, common words are, God
  save ye, Fare ye well; common actions, flattery and
  cozenage; common things, women and cuckolds.--And
  how does my little Ferrard? Ah, ye lecherous animal!--my
  little ferret, he goes sucking up and down the palace
  into every hen's nest, like a weasel:--and to what dost
  thou addict thy time to now more than to those antique
  painted drabs that are still effected of young
  courtiers,--flattery, pride, and venery?

  _Fer._ I study languages. Who dost think to be the
  best linguist of our age?                                        70

  _Mal._ Phew! the devil: let him possess thee; he'll
  teach thee to speak all languages most readily and
  strangely;[360] and great reason, marry, he's travelled greatly
  i' the world, and is everywhere.

  _Fer._ Save i' the court.

  _Mal._ Ay, save i' the court.--[_To_ BILIOSO.] And how
  does my old muckhill, overspread with fresh snow? thou
  half a man, half a goat, all a beast! how does thy young
  wife, old huddle?[361]

  _Bil._ Out, you improvident rascal!                              80

  _Mal._ Do, kick, thou hugely-horned old duke's ox,
  good Master Make-pleas.

  _Pietro._ How dost thou live nowadays, Malevole?

  _Mal._ Why, like the knight Sir Patrick Penlohans,[362]
  with killing o' spiders for my lady's monkey.[363]

  _Pietro._ How dost spend the night? I hear thou never
  sleepest.

  _Mal._ O, no; but dream the most fantastical! O heaven!
  O fubbery, fubbery!

  _Pietro._ Dream! what dreamest?                                  90

  _Mal._ Why, methinks I see that signior pawn his footcloth,[364]
  that metreza[365] her plate: this madam takes physic,
  that t'other monsieur may minister to her: here is a
  pander jewelled; there is[366] a fellow in shift of satin this
  day, that could not shift a shirt t'other night: here a Paris
  supports that Helen; there's a Lady Guinever bears up
  that Sir Lancelot: dreams, dreams, visions, fantasies,
  chimeras, imaginations, tricks, conceits!--[_To_ PREPASSO.]
  Sir Tristram Trimtram, come aloft,[367] Jack-an-apes, with a
  whim-wham: here's a knight of the land of Catito shall
  play at trap with any page in Europe; do the sword-dance
  with any morris-dancer in Christendom; ride at
  the ring[368] till the fin[369] of his eyes look as blue as the
  welkin; and run the wildgoose-chase even with Pompey
  the Huge.[370]                                                  105

  _Pietro._ You run!

  _Mal._ To the devil.--Now, signior Guerrino, that thou
  from a most pitied prisoner shouldst grow a most loathed
  flatterer!--Alas, poor Celso, thy star's oppressed: thou
  art an honest lord: 'tis pity.                                  110

  _Equato._ Is't pity?

  _Mal._ Ay, marry is't, philosophical Equato; and 'tis
  pity that thou, being so excellent a scholar by art, should
  be so ridiculous a fool by nature.--I have a thing to tell
  you, duke: bid 'em avaunt, bid 'em avaunt.

  _Pietro._ Leave us, leave us.

                          [_Exeunt all except_ PIETRO _and_ MALEVOLE.

  Now, sir, what is't?

  _Mal._ Duke, thou art a becco,[371] a cornuto.

  _Pietro._ How!

  _Mal._ Thou art a cuckold.                                      120

  _Pietro._ Speak, unshale[372] him quick.

  _Mal._ With most tumbler-like nimbleness.

  _Pietro._ Who? by whom? I burst with desire.

  _Mal._ Mendoza is the man makes thee a horned beast;
  duke, 'tis Mendoza cornutes thee.

  _Pietro._ What conformance? relate; short, short.

  _Mal._ As a lawyer's beard.
  There is an old crone in the court, her name is Maquerelle,
  She is my mistress, sooth to say, and she doth ever tell me.
  Blirt o' rhyme, blirt o' rhyme! Maquerelle is a cunning
  bawd; I am an honest villain; thy wife is a close drab;
  and thou art a notorious cuckold. Farewell, duke.               132

  _Pietro._ Stay, stay.

  _Mal._ Dull, dull duke, can lazy patience make lame
  revenge? O God, for a woman to make a man that
  which God never created, never made!

  _Pietro._ What did God never make?

  _Mal._ A cuckold: to be made a thing that's hoodwinked
  with kindness, whilst every rascal fillips his
  brows; to have a coxcomb with egregious horns pinned
  to a lord's back, every page sporting himself with delightful
  laughter, whilst he must be the last must know it:
  pistols and poniards! pistols and poniards!                     143

  _Pietro._ Death and damnation!

  _Mal._ Lightning and thunder!

  _Pietro._ Vengeance and torture!

  _Mal._ Catso![373]

  _Pietro._ O, revenge!

  _Mal._[374] Nay, to select among ten thousand fairs
  A lady far inferior to the most,
  In fair proportion both of limb and soul;
  To take her from austerer check of parents,
  To make her his by most devoutful rites,                        150
  Make her commandress of a better essence
  Than is the gorgeous world, even of a man;
  To hug her with as rais'd an appetite
  As usurers do their delv'd-up treasury
  (Thinking none tells it but his private self);
  To meet her spirit in a nimble kiss,
  Distilling panting ardour to her heart;
  True to her sheets, nay, diets strong his blood,
  To give her height of hymeneal sweets,----

  _Pietro._ O God!                                                160

  _Mal._ Whilst she lisps, and gives him some
     court-_quelquechose_,[375]
  Made only to provoke, not satiate:
  And yet even then the thaw of her delight
  Flows from lewd heat of apprehension,
  Only from strange imagination's rankness,
  That forms the adulterer's presence in her soul,
  And makes her think she clips the foul knave's loins.

  _Pietro._ Affliction to my blood's root!

  _Mal._ Nay, think, but think what may proceed of this;
  Adultery is often the mother of incest.                         170

  _Pietro._ Incest!

  _Mal._ Yes, incest: mark:--Mendoza of his wife begets
  perchance a daughter: Mendoza dies; his son marries
  this daughter: say you? nay, 'tis frequent, not only
  probable, but no question often acted, whilst ignorance,
  fearless ignorance, clasps his own seed.

  _Pietro._ Hideous imagination!

  _Mal._ Adultery? why, next to the sin of simony, 'tis
  the most horrid transgression under the cope of salvation.      180

  _Pietro._ Next to simony!

  _Mal._ Ay, next to simony, in which our men in next
  age shall not sin.

  _Pietro._ Not sin! why?

  _Mal._ Because (thanks to some churchmen) our age
  will leave them nothing to sin with. But adultery, O
  dulness! should show[376] exemplary punishment, that intemperate
  bloods may freeze but to think it. I would
  damn him and all his generation: my own hands should
  do it; ha, I would not trust heaven with my vengeance:
  --anything.                                                     191

  _Pietro._ Anything, anything, Malevole: thou shalt see
  instantly what temper my spirit holds. Farewell; remember
  I forget thee not; farewell.

                                                       [_Exit_ PIETRO.

  _Mal._[377] Farewell.
  Lean thoughtfulness, a sallow meditation,
  Suck thy veins dry, distemperance rob thy sleep!
  The heart's disquiet is revenge most deep:
  He that gets blood, the life of flesh but spills,
  But he that breaks heart's peace, the dear soul kills.          200
  Well, this disguise doth yet afford me that
  Which kings do seldom hear, or great men use,--
  Free speech: and though my state's usurp'd,
  Yet this affected strain gives me a tongue
  As fetterless as in an emperor's.
  I may speak foolishly, ay, knavishly,
  Always carelessly, yet no one thinks it fashion
  To poise my breath; for he that laughs and strikes
  Is lightly felt, or seldom struck again.
  Duke, I'll torment thee now; my just revenge                    210
  From thee than crown a richer gem shall part:
  Beneath God, naught's so dear as a calm heart.

                         _Re-enter_ CELSO.

  _Celso._ My honour'd lord,--

  _Mal._ Peace, speak low, peace! O Celso, constant lord,
  (Thou to whose faith I only rest discover'd,
  Thou, one of full ten millions of men,
  That lovest virtue only for itself;
  Thou in whose hands old Ops may put her soul)
  Behold forever-banish'd Altofront,
  This Genoa's last year's duke. O truly noble!                   220
  I wanted those old instruments of state,
  Dissemblance and suspect: I could not time it, Celso;
  My throne stood like a point midst[378] of a circle,
  To all of equal nearness; bore with none;
  Rein'd all alike; so slept in fearless virtue,
  Suspectless, too suspectless; till the crowd,
  (Still lickorous of untried novelties)
  Impatient with severer government
  Made strong with Florence, banish'd Altofront.

  _Celso._ Strong with Florence! ay, thence your mischief rose;   230
  For when the daughter of the Florentine
  Was match'd once with this Pietro, now duke,
  No stratagem of state untried was left,
  Till you of all----

  _Mal._ Of all was quite bereft:
  Alas, Maria too close prison�d,
  My true-faith'd duchess, i' the citadel!

  _Celso._ I'll still adhere: let's mutiny and die.

  _Mal._ O, no,[379] climb not a falling tower, Celso;
  'Tis well held desperation, no zeal,
  Hopeless to strive with fate: peace; temporise.                 240
  Hope, hope, that ne'er forsak'st the wretched'st man,
  Yet bidd'st me live, and lurk in this disguise!
  What, play I well the free-breath'd discontent?
  Why, man, we are all philosophical monarchs
  Or natural fools. Celso, the court's a-fire;
  The duchess' sheets will smoke for't ere't be long:
  Impure Mendoza, that sharp-nos'd lord, that made
  The curs�d match link'd Genoa with Florence,
  Now broad-horns the duke, which he now knows.
  Discord to malcontents is very manna:                           250
  When the ranks are burst, then scuffle, Altofront.

  _Celso._ Ay, but durst----

  _Mal._ 'Tis gone; 'tis swallow'd like a mineral:
  Some way 'twill work; pheut, I'll not shrink:
  He's resolute who can no lower sink.


  BILIOSO _re-entering_, MALEVOLE _shifteth his speech_.


  O[380] the father of May-poles! did you never see a
  fellow whose strength consisted in his breath, respect
  in his office, religion in[381] his lord, and love in himself?
  why, then, behold.

  _Bil._ Signior,--                                               260

  _Mal._ My right worshipful lord, your court night-cap
  makes you have a passing high forehead.

  _Bil._ I can tell you strange news, but I am sure you
  know them already: the duke speaks much good of you.

  _Mal._ Go to, then: and shall you and I now enter
  into a strict friendship?

  _Bil._ Second one another?

  _Mal._ Yes.

  _Bil._ Do one another good offices?

  _Mal._ Just: what though I called thee old ox, egregious
  wittol, broken-bellied coward, rotten mummy? yet, since
  I am in favour----                                              272

  _Bil._ Words of course, terms of disport. His grace
  presents you by me a chain, as his grateful remembrance
  for--I am ignorant for what; marry, ye may impart: yet
  howsoever--come--dear friend; dost know my son?

  _Mal._ Your son!

  _Bil._ He shall eat wood-cocks, dance jigs, make
  possets, and play at shuttle-cock with any young lord
  about the court: he has as sweet a lady too; dost know
  her little bitch?                                               281

  _Mal._ 'Tis a dog, man.

  _Bil._ Believe me, a she-bitch: O, 'tis a good creature!
  thou shalt be her servant. I'll make thee acquainted with
  nothing. 'Tis grown to supper-time; come to my table:
  that, anything I have, stands open to thee.

  _Mal._ [_aside to_ CELSO] How smooth to him that is in state
      of grace,
  How servile is the rugged'st courtier's face!
  What profit, nay, what nature would keep down,                  290
  Are heav'd to them are minions to a crown.
  Envious ambition never sates his thirst,
  Till sucking all, he swells and swells, and burst.[382]

  _Bil._ I shall now leave you with my always-best wishes;
  only let's hold betwixt us a firm correspondence, a mutual
  friendly-reciprocal kind of steady-unanimous-heartily-leagued----

  _Mal._ Did your signiorship ne'er see a pigeon-house
  that was smooth, round, and white without, and full of
  holes and stink within? ha' ye not, old courtier?               300

  _Bil._ O, yes, 'tis the form, the fashion of them all.

  _Mal._ Adieu, my true court-friend; farewell, my dear
  Castilio.[383]

                                                     [_Exit_ BILIOSO.

  _Celso._ Yonder's Mendoza.

  _Mal._ True, the privy-key.

                                                 [_Descries_ MENDOZA.

  _Celso._ I take my leave, sweet lord.

  _Mal._ 'Tis fit; away!

                                                       [_Exit_ CELSO.

           _Enter_ MENDOZA _with three or four Suitors_.


  _Men._ Leave your suits with me; I can and will:
  attend my secretary; leave me.

                                                   [_Exeunt Suitors._

  _Mal._ Mendoza, hark ye, hark ye. You are a
  treacherous villain: God b' wi' ye!

  _Men._ Out, you base-born rascal!                               310

  _Mal._ We are all the sons of heaven, though a tripe-wife
  were our mother: ah, you whoreson, hot-reined he-marmoset!
  �gisthus! didst ever hear of one �gisthus?

  _Men._ Gisthus?

  _Mal._ Ay, �gisthus: he was a filthy incontinent fleshmonger,
  such a one as thou art.

  _Men._ Out, grumbling rogue!

  _Mal._ Orestes, beware Orestes!

  _Men._ Out, beggar!

  _Mal._ I once shall rise.                                       320

  _Men._ Thou rise!

  _Mal._ Ay, at the resurrection.
  No vulgar seed but once may rise and shall;
  No king so huge but 'fore he die may fall.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Men._ Now, good Elysium! what a delicious heaven
  is it for a man to be in a prince's favour! O sweet
  God! O pleasure! O fortune! O all thou best of
  life! what should I think, what say, what do to be a
  favourite, a minion? to have a general timorous respect
  observe a man, a stateful silence in his presence, solitariness
  in his absence, a confused hum and busy murmur
  of obsequious suitors training him; the cloth held up,
  and way proclaimed before him; petitionary vassals
  licking the pavement with their slavish knees, whilst
  some odd palace-lampreels that engender with snakes,
  and are full of eyes on both sides, with a kind of insinuated[384]
  humbleness, fix all their delights[385] upon his
  brow. O blessed state! what a ravishing prospect
  doth the Olympus of favour yield! Death, I cornute
  the duke! Sweet women! most sweet ladies! nay,
  angels! by heaven, he is more accursed than a devil
  that hates you, or is hated by you; and happier than a
  god that loves you, or is beloved by you: you preservers
  of mankind, life-blood of society, who would live, nay,
  who can live without you? O paradise! how majestical
  is your austerer presence! how imperiously chaste is
  your more modest face! but, O, how full of ravishing
  attraction is your pretty, petulant, languishing,
  lasciviously-composed countenance! these amorous smiles, those
  soul-warming sparkling glances, ardent as those flames
  that singed the world by heedless Phaeton! in body
  how delicate,[386] in soul how witty, in discourse how pregnant,
  in life how wary, in favours how judicious, in day how
  sociable, and in night how---- O pleasure unutterable!
  indeed, it is most certain, one man cannot deserve only
  to enjoy a beauteous woman: but a duchess! in despite
  of Phoebus, I'll write a sonnet instantly in praise of
  her.                                                            357

                             SCENE II.

                  _Palace of the Duke of Genoa._

     _Enter_ FERNEZE _ushering_ AURELIA, EMILIA _and_ MAQUERELLE
          _bearing up her train_, BIANCA _attending: then
                   exeunt_ EMILIA _and_ BIANCA.

  _Aurel._ And is't possible? Mendoza slight me!
  possible?

  _Fer._ Possible!
  What can be strange in him that's drank with favour,[387]
  Grows insolent with grace?--Speak, Maquerelle, speak.

  _Maq._ To speak feelingly, more, more richly in solid
  sense than worthless words, give me those jewels of your
  ears to receive my enforced duty. As for my part, 'tis
  well known I can put up[388] anything [FERNEZE _privately
  feeds_ MAQUERELLE'S _hands with jewels during this speech_];
  can bear patiently with any man: but when I heard he
  wronged your precious sweetness, I was enforced to take
  deep offence. 'Tis most certain he loves Emilia with high
  appetite: and, as she told me (as you know we women
  impart our secrets one to another), when she repulsed his
  suit, in that he was possessed with your endeared grace,
  Mendoza most ingratefully renounced all faith to you.            16

  _Fer._ Nay, called you--Speak, Maquerelle, speak.

  Maq. By heaven, witch, dried biscuit; and contested
  blushlessly he loved you but for a spurt or so.

  _Fer._ For maintenance.

  _Maq._ Advancement and regard.

  _Aurel._ O villain! O impudent Mendoza!

  _Maq._ Nay, he is the rustiest-jawed,[389] the foulest-mouthed
  knave in railing against our sex: he will rail
  against[390] women--

  _Aurel._ How? how?

  _Maq._ I am ashamed to speak't, I.

  _Aurel._ I love to hate him: speak.

  _Maq._ Why, when Emilia scorned his base unsteadiness,
  the black-throated rascal scolded, and said--                    30

  _Aurel._ What?

  _Maq._ Troth, 'tis too shameless.

  _Aurel._ What said he?

  _Maq._ Why, that, at four, women were fools; at fourteen,
  drabs; at forty, bawds; at fourscore, witches; and
  [at] a hundred, cats.

  _Aurel._ O unlimitable impudency!

  _Fer._ But as for poor Ferneze's fix�d heart,
  Was never shadeless meadow drier parch'd
  Under the scorching heat of heaven's dog,                        40
  Than is my heart with your enforcing eyes.

  _Maq._ A hot simile.

  _Fer._ Your smiles have been my heaven, your frowns my hell:
  O, pity, then! grace should with beauty dwell.

  _Maq._ Reasonable perfect, by'r lady.

  _Aurel._ I will love thee, be it but in despite
  Of that Mendoza:--witch!--Ferneze,--witch!--
  Ferneze, thou art the duchess' favourite:
  Be faithful, private: but 'tis dangerous.

  _Fer._ His love is lifeless that for love fears breath:          50
  The worst that's due to sin, O, would 'twere death!

  _Aurel._ Enjoy my favour. I will be sick instantly and
  take physic: therefore in depth of night visit--

  _Maq._ Visit her chamber, but conditionally you shall
  not offend her bed: by this diamond!

  _Fer._ By this diamond.                   [_Giving diamond to_ MAQ.

  _Maq._ Nor tarry longer than you please: by this ruby!

  _Fer._ By this ruby.                         [_Giving ruby to_ MAQ.

  _Maq._ And that the door shall not creak.                        60

  _Fer._ And that the door shall not creak.

  _Maq._ Nay, but swear.

  _Fer._ By this purse.                       [_Giving purse to_ MAQ.

  _Maq._ Go to, I'll keep your oaths for you: remember,
  visit.

  _Aurel._ Dried biscuit!--Look where the base wretch
  comes.

               _Enter_ MENDOZA, _reading a sonnet_.

  _Men._ "_Beauty's life, heaven's model, love's queen_,"--

  _Maq._ That's his Emilia.

  _Men._ "_Natures triumph, best on[391] earth_,"--                70

  _Maq._ Meaning Emilia.

  _Men._ "_Thou only wonder that the world hath seen_,"--

  _Maq._ That's Emilia.

  _Aurel._ Must I, then, hear her praised?--Mendoza!

  _Men._ Madam, your excellency is graciously encountered:
  I have been writing passionate flashes in
  honour of--

                                                     [_Exit_ FERNEZE.

  _Aurel._ Out, villain, villain!
  O judgment, where have been my eyes? what
  Bewitch'd election made me dote on thee?                         80
  What sorcery made me love thee? But, be gone;
  Bury thy head. O, that I could do more
  Than loath thee! hence, worst of ill!
  No reason ask, our reason is our will.[392]

                                             [_Exit with_ MAQUERELLE.

  _Men._ Women! nay, Furies; nay, worse; for they
  torment only the bad, but women good and bad.
  Damnation of mankind! Breath, hast thou praised
  them for this? and is't you, Ferneze, are wriggled into
  smock-grace? sit sure. O, that I could rail against
  these monsters in nature, models of hell, curse of the
  earth, women! that dare attempt anything, and what
  they attempt they care not how they accomplish; without
  all premeditation or prevention; rash in asking,
  desperate in working, impatient in suffering, extreme in
  desiring, slaves unto appetite, mistresses in dissembling,
  only constant in unconstancy, only perfect in counterfeiting:
  their words are feigned, their eyes forged, their
  sighs[393] dissembled, their looks counterfeit, their hair
  false, their given hopes deceitful, their very breath
  artificial: their blood is their only god; bad clothes,
  and old age, are only the devils they tremble at. That
  I could rail now!                                               102

                _Enter_ PIETRO, _his sword drawn_.

  _Pietro._ A mischief fill thy throat, thou foul-jaw'd slave!
  Say thy prayers.

  _Men._ I ha' forgot 'em.

  _Pietro._ Thou shalt die.

  _Men._ So shalt thou. I am heart-mad.

  _Pietro._ I am horn-mad.

  _Men._ Extreme mad.

  _Pietro._ Monstrously mad.

  _Men._ Why?                                                     111

  _Pietro._ Why! thou, thou hast dishonoured my bed.

  _Men._ I! Come, come, sit; here's my bare heart to thee,
  As steady as is the centre to this[394] glorious world:
  And yet, hark, thou art a cornuto,--but by me?

  _Pietro._ Yes, slave, by thee.

  _Men._ Do not, do not with tart and spleenful breath
  Lose him can lose thee. I offend my duke!
  Bear record, O ye dumb and raw-air'd nights,
  How vigilant my sleepless eyes have been                        120
  To watch the traitor! record, thou spirit of truth,
  With what debasement I ha' thrown myself
  To under offices, only to learn
  The truth, the party, time, the means, the place,
  By whom, and when, and where thou wert disgrac'd!
  And am I paid with slave? hath my intrusion
  To places private and prohibited,
  Only to observe the closer passages,
  Heaven knows with vows of revelation,
  Made me suspected, made me deem'd a villain?                    130
  What rogue hath wrong'd us?

  _Pietro._ Mendoza, I may err.

  _Men._ Err! 'tis too mild a name: but err and err,
  Run giddy with suspect, 'fore through me thou know
  That which most creatures, save thyself, do know:
  Nay, since my service hath so loath'd reject,
  'Fore I'll reveal, shalt find them clipt together.

  _Pietro._ Mendoza, thou knowest I am a most plain-breasted
  man.

  _Men._ The fitter to make a cornuto:[395] would your
  brows were most plain too!                                      140

  _Pietro._ Tell me: indeed, I heard thee rail--

  _Men._ At women, true: why, what cold fleam[396] could choose,
  Knowing a lord so honest, virtuous,
  So boundless loving, bounteous, fair-shap'd, sweet,
  To be contemn'd, abus'd, defam'd, made cuckold?
  Heart! I hate all women for't: sweet sheets, wax lights,
  antic bedposts, cambric smocks, villainous curtains, arras
  pictures, oiled hinges, and all the[397] tongue-tied lascivious
  witnesses of great creatures' wantonness,--what salvation
  can you expect?                                                 150

  _Pietro._ Wilt thou tell me?

  _Men._ Why, you may find it yourself; observe,
  observe.

  _Pietro._ I ha' not the patience: wilt thou deserve me,
  tell, give it.

  _Men._ Take't: why, Ferneze is the man, Ferneze: I'll
  prove't; this night you shall take him in your sheets:
  will't serve?

  _Pietro._ It will; my bosom's in some peace: till night--

  _Men._ What?

  _Pietro._ Farewell.

  _Men._ God! how weak a lord are you!                            160
  Why, do you think there is no more but so?

  _Pietro._ Why!

  _Men._ Nay, then, will I presume to counsel you:
  It should be thus. You with some guard upon the sudden
  Break into the princess' chamber: I stay behind,
  Without the door, through which he needs must pass:
  Ferneze flies; let him: to me he comes; he's kill'd
  By me, observe, by me: you follow: I rail,
  And seem to save the body. Duchess comes,
  On whom (respecting her advanc�d birth,                         170
  And your fair nature), I know, nay, I do know,
  No violence must be us'd; she comes: I storm,
  I praise, excuse Ferneze, and still maintain
  The duchess' honour: she for this loves me.
  I honour you; shall know her soul, you mine:
  Then naught shall she contrive in vengeance
  (As women are most thoughtful in revenge)
  Of her Ferneze, but you shall sooner know't
  Than she can think't. Thus shall his death come sure,
  Your duchess brain-caught: so your life secure.                 180

  _Pietro._ It is too well: my bosom and my heart
  When nothing helps, cut off the rotten part.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Men._ Who cannot feign friendship can ne'er produce
  the effects of hatred. Honest fool duke! subtle lascivious
  duchess! silly novice Ferneze! I do laugh at ye. My
  brain is in labour till it produce mischief, and I feel
  sudden throes, proofs sensible, the issue is at hand.
  As bears shape young, so I'll form my device,
  Which grown proves horrid: vengeance makes men wise.

                                                             [_Exit._

                          SCENE III.[398]

                _The palace of the Duke of Genoa._

                _Enter_ MALEVOLE _and_ PASSARELLO.

  _Mal._ Fool, most happily encountered: canst sing,
  fool?

  _Pass._ Yes, I can sing, fool, if you'll bear the burden;
  and I can play upon instruments, scurvily, as gentlemen
  do. O, that I had been gelded! I should then have
  been a fat fool for a chamber, a squeaking fool for a
  tavern, and a private fool for all the ladies.

  _Mal._ You are in good case since you came to court,
  fool: what, guarded, guarded![399]                                9

  _Pass._ Yes, faith, even as footmen and bawds wear
  velvet, not for an ornament of honour, but for a badge
  of drudgery; for, now the duke is discontented, I am
  fain to fool him asleep every night.

  _Mal._ What are his griefs?

  _Pass._ He hath sore eyes.

  _Mal._ I never observed so much.

  _Pass._ Horrible sore eyes; and so hath every cuckold,
  for the roots of the horns spring in the eyeballs, and
  that's the reason the horn of a cuckold is as tender as
  his eye, or as that growing in the woman's forehead twelve
  years since,[400] that could not endure to be touched. The
  duke hangs down his head like a columbine.                       22

  _Mal._ Passarello, why do great men beg fools?[401]

  _Pass._ As the Welshman stole rushes when there was
  nothing else to filch; only to keep begging in fashion.

  _Mal._ Pooh, thou givest no good reason; thou speakest
  like a fool.

  _Pass._ Faith, I utter small fragments, as your knight
  courts your city widow with jingling[402] of his gilt spurs,
  advancing his bush-coloured beard,[403] and taking tobacco:
  this is all the mirror of their knightly complements.[404] Nay,
  I shall talk when my tongue is a-going once; 'tis like a
  citizen on horseback, evermore in a false gallop.                33

  _Mal._ And how doth Maquerelle fare nowadays?

  _Pass._ Faith, I was wont to salute her as our English
  women are at their first landing in Flushing;[405] I would
  call her whore: but now that antiquity leaves her as an
  old piece of plastic[406] to work by, I only ask her how her
  rotten teeth fare every morning, and so leave her. She
  was the first that ever invented perfumed smocks for the
  gentlewomen, and woollen shoes, for fear of creaking
  for the visitant. She were an excellent lady, but that
  her face peeleth like Muscovy glass.[407]                        43

  _Mal._ And how doth thy old lord, that hath wit enough
  to be a flatterer, and conscience enough to be a knave?

  _Pass._ O, excellent: he keeps beside me fifteen jesters,
  to instruct him in the art of fooling, and utters their jests
  in private to the duke and duchess: he'll lie like to
  your Switzer or lawyer; he'll be of any side for most
  money.                                                           50

  _Mal._ I am in haste, be brief.

  _Pass._ As your fiddler when he is paid.--He'll thrive,
  I warrant you, while your young courtier stands like
  Good-Friday in Lent; men long to see it, because more
  fatting days come after it; else he's the leanest and pitifullest
  actor in the whole pageant. Adieu, Malevole.

  _Mal._ [_Aside._] O world most vile, when thy loose vanities,
  Taught by this fool, do make the fool seem wise!

  _Pass._ You'll know me again, Malevole.

  _Mal._ O, ay, by that velvet.                                    60

  _Pass._ Ay, as a pettifogger by his buckram bag. I
  am as common in the court as an hostess's lips in the
  country; knights, and clowns, and knaves, and all share
  me: the court cannot possibly be without me. Adieu,
  Malevole.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [398] This scene was added in ed. 2.

     [399] Ornamented with _guards_ or facings.--The coats of fools
     were commonly guarded.

     [400] "The woman with the horn in her forehead was probably
     Margaret Griffith, wife of David Owen, of Llan Gaduain, in
     Montgomery. A portrait of her is in existence, prefixed to a
     scarce pamphlet, entitled, '_A miraculous and monstrous, but yet
     most true and certayne Discourse of a Woman, now to be seen in
     London, of the age of threescore yeares or thereabouts, in the
     midst of whose forehead there groweth out a crooked Horne of four
     ynches long. Imprinted at London, by Thomas Orwin, and are to be
     sold by Edward White, dwelling at the little north dore of Paules
     Church, at the signe of the Gun_, 1588.'"--_Gilchrist._

     [401] _To beg a person for a fool_ was to apply to be made
     guardian of a person who had been legally proved to be an idiot.
     It was in the king's power to grant the custody of an idiot's
     person and the profits of his estate to any subject.

     [402] Gallants prided themselves on wearing spurs that jingled.
     Middleton, after elaborately describing a young prodigal's
     attire, adds:--"Lastly, he walked the chamber with such a
     pestilent jingle that his spurs over-squeaked the lawyer"
     (_Works_, viii. 71). So Chapman in _Monsieur D'Olive_:--"You may
     hear them (the gallants) half a mile ere they come at you--six or
     seven make a perfect morice-dance; they need no bells, their
     spurs serve their turn."

     [403] This is the reading of Dyce's copy of ed. 2. Other copies
     read:-- "Faith, I utter small fragments as your knight courtes
     your Citty widow _with something of his guilt: some aduancing his
     high-colored beard_," &c.

     [404] Accomplishments.

     [405] "At this time Flushing was in the hands of the English as
     part of the security for money advanced by Queen Elizabeth to the
     Dutch. The governor and garrison were all Englishmen."--_Reed._

     [406] Model in wax or clay.

     [407] Talc.--Reed quotes from Giles Fletcher's _Russe
     Commonwealth_, 1591, p. 10:--"In the province of Corelia, and
     about the river Duyna towards the North-sea, there groweth a soft
     rock which they call Slude. This they cut into pieces, and so
     tear it into thin _flakes, which naturally it is apt for_, and so
     use it for glasse lanthorns and such like. It giveth both inwards
     and outwards a clearer light then glasse, and for this respect is
     better than either glasse or horne; for that it neither breaketh
     like glasse, nor yet will burne like the lanthorne."

                             SCENE I.

                  _Chamber in the Duke's Palace._

  _Enter_ MENDOZA _with a sconce,[408] to observe_ FERNEZE'S
  _entrance, who, whilst the act is playing, enters unbraced, two
  Pages before him with lights; is met by_ MAQUERELLE _and conveyed
  in; the Pages[409] are sent away_.

  _Men._ He's caught, the woodcock's head is i' the noose.
  Now treads Ferneze in dangerous path of lust,
  Swearing his sense is merely[410] deified:
  The fool grasps clouds, and shall beget Centaurs:
  And now, in strength of panting faint delight,
  The goat bids heaven envy him. Good goose,
  I can afford thee nothing
  But the poor comfort of calamity, pity.
  Lust's like the plummets hanging on clock-lines,
  Will ne'er ha' done till all is quite undone;                    10
  Such is the course salt sallow lust doth run;
  Which thou shalt try. I'll be reveng'd. Duke, thy suspect;
  Duchess, thy disgrace; Ferneze, thy rivalship;
  Shall have swift vengeance. Nothing so holy,
  No band of nature so strong,
  No law of friendship so sacred,
  But I'll profane, burst, violate, 'fore I'll
  Endure disgrace, contempt, and poverty.
  Shall I, whose very hum struck all heads bare,
  Whose face made silence, creaking of whose shoe                  20
  Forc'd the most private passages fly ope,
  Scrape like a servile dog at some latch'd door?
  Learn how to make a leg, and cry "Beseech ye,
  Pray ye, is such a lord within?" be aw'd
  At some odd usher's scoff'd formality?
  First sear my brains! _Unde cadis, non quo, refert_;[411]
  My heart cries, "Perish all!" How! how! what fate
  Can once avoid revenge, that's desperate?
  I'll to the duke: if all should ope--if! tush,
  Fortune still dotes on those who cannot blush.                   30

                                                             [_Exit._


     [408] Lantern.

     [409] Some copies of ed. 1. "the Dutches pages."

     [410] Wholly.

     [411] See note 1, p. 49.


                             SCENE II.

                  _Chamber in the Duke's Palace._

       _Enter_ MALEVOLE _at one door_; BIANCA, EMILIA, _and_
                  MAQUERELLE _at the other door_.

  _Mal._ Bless ye, cast o' ladies![412]--Ha, dipsas![413] how
  dost thou, old coal?

  _Maq._ Old coal!

  _Mal._ Ay, old coal: methinks thou liest like a brand
  under these[414] billets of green wood. He that will inflame
  a young wench's heart, let him lay close to her an old
  coal that hath first been fired, a panderess, my half-burnt
  lint, who though thou canst not flame thyself, yet art
  able to set a thousand virgin's tapers afire.--And how
  does[415] Janivere thy husband, my little periwinkle? is he
  troubled with the cough o' the lungs still? does he hawk
  o' nights still? he will not bite.                               12

  _Bian._ No, by my troth, I took him with his mouth
  empty of old teeth.

  _Mal._ And he took thee with thy belly full of young
  bones: marry, he took his maim by the stroke of his
  enemy.

  _Bian._ And I mine by the stroke of my friend.

  _Mal._ The close stock![416] O mortal wench! Lady,
  ha' ye now no restoratives for your decayed Jasons?[417]
  look ye, crab's guts baked,[418] distilled ox-pith,[419] the
  pulverised hairs of a lion's upper-lip, jelly of cock-sparrows,
  he-monkey's marrow, or powder of fox-stones?--And
  whither are all[420] you ambling now?                            24

  _Bian._ Why,[421] to bed, to bed.

  _Mal._ Do your husbands lie with ye?

  _Bian._ That were country fashion, i'faith.

  _Mal._ Ha' ye no foregoers about you? come, whither
  in good deed, la, now?

  _Maq._[422] In good indeed, la, now, to eat the most
  miraculously, admirably, astonishable composed posset
  with three curds, without any drink. Will ye help me
  with a he-fox?--Here's the duke.                                 33

  _Mal._[423] Fried frogs are very good, and French-like, too.

                                                    [_Exeunt Ladies._

       _Enter_ PIETRO, CELSO, EQUATO, BILIOSO, FERRARDO, _and_
                              MENDOZA.

  _Pietro._ The night grows deep and foul: what hour is't?

  _Celso._ Upon the stroke of twelve.

  _Mal._ Save ye, duke!

  _Pietro._ From thee: begone, I do not love thee; let
  me see thee no more; we are displeased.

  _Mal._ Why, God b'wi' thee![424] Heaven hear my
  curse,--may thy wife and thee live long together!                41

  _Pietro._ Begone, sirrah!

  _Mal. When Arthur first in court began_,[425]--Agamemnon
  --Menelaus--was ever any duke a cornuto?

  _Pietro._ Begone, hence!

  _Mal._ What religion wilt thou be of next?

  _Men._ Out with him!

  _Mal._ With most servile patience.--Time will come
  When wonder of thy error will strike dumb
  Thy bezzled[426] sense.--                                        50
  Slaves! ay, favour: ay, marry, shall he rise:[427]
  Good God! how subtle hell doth flatter vice!
  Mounts[428] him aloft, and makes him seem to fly,
  As fowl the tortoise mock'd, who to the sky
  The ambitious shell-fish rais'd! the end of all
  Is only, that from height he might dead fall.

  _Bil._[429] Why, when?[430] out, ye rogue! begone, ye rascal!

  _Mal._ I shall now leave ye with all my best wishes.

  _Bil._ Out, ye cur!

  _Mal._ Only let's hold together a firm correspondence.

  _Bil._ Out!                                                      61

  _Mal._ A mutual-friendly-reciprocal-perpetual kind of
  steady-unanimous-heartily-leagued--

  _Bil._ Hence, ye gross-jawed, peasantly--out, go!

  _Mal._ Adieu, pigeon-house; thou burr, that only
  stickest to nappy fortunes. The serpigo, the strangury,
  an eternal uneffectual priapism seize thee!

  _Bil._ Out, rogue!

  _Mal._ May'st thou be a notorious wittolly pander to
  thine own wife, and yet get no office, but live to be
  the utmost misery of mankind, a beggarly cuckold!                71

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Pietro._ It shall be so.

  _Men._ It must be so, for where great states revenge,
  'Tis requisite the parts be closely dogg'd,[431]
  (Which piety and soft respect forbears).
  Lay one into his breast shall sleep with him,
  Feed in the same dish, run in self-faction,
  Who may discover[432] any shape of danger;
  For once disgrac'd, display�d[433] in offence,
  It makes man blushless, and man is (all confess)                 80
  More prone to vengeance than to gratefulness.
  Favours are writ in dust; but stripes we feel
  Deprav�d nature stamps in lasting steel.

  _Pietro._ You shall be leagu'd with the duchess.

  _Equato._ The plot is very good.

  _Pietro._[434] You shall both kill, and seem the corse to save.

  _Fer._ A most fine brain-trick.

  _Celso._ [_aside_] Of a most cunning knave.

  _Pietro._ My lords, the heavy action we intend
  Is death and shame, two of the ugliest shapes
  That can confound a soul; think, think of it:                    90
  I strike, but yet, like him that 'gainst stone walls
  Directs, his shafts rebound in his own face;
  My lady's shame is mine, O God, 'tis mine!
  Therefore I do conjure all secrecy:
  Let it be as very little as may be,
  Pray ye, as may be.
  Make frightless entrance, salute her with soft eyes,
  Stain naught with blood; only Ferneze dies,
  But not before her brows. O gentlemen,
  God knows I love her! Nothing else, but this:--                 100
  I am not well: if grief, that sucks veins dry,
  Rivels[435] the skin, casts ashes in men's faces,
  Be-dulls the eye, unstrengthens all the blood,
  Chance to remove me to another world,
  As sure I once must die, let him succeed:
  I have no child; all that my youth begot
  Hath been your loves, which shall inherit me:
  Which as it ever shall, I do conjure it,
  Mendoza may succeed: he's nobly[436] born;
  With me of much desert.

  _Celso._ [_aside_] Much![437]                                   110

  _Pietro._ Your silence answers, "Ay:"
  I thank you. Come on now. O, that I might die
  Before her shame's display'd! would I were forc'd
  To burn my father's tomb, unheal[438] his bones,
  And dash them in the dirt, rather than this!
  This both the living and the dead offends:
  Sharp surgery where naught but death amends.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [412] "Cast o' ladies"--couple of ladies.

     [413] A very venomous little serpent. "A man or beast wounded
     with this serpent," says Topsel in his _Hist. of Serpents_ (ed.
     1658, p. 699), "is afflicted with intolerable thirst, insomuch as
     it is easier for him to break his belly than to quench his thirst
     with drinking; always gaping like a bull, casteth himself down
     into the water and maketh no spare of the cold liquor, but
     continually sucketh it in till either the belly break or the
     poison drive out the life by overcoming the vital spirits."

     [414] Omitted in ed. 2.--"A maquerela, in plain English a bawd,"
     says Overbury in his _Characters_, "is an old charcoal that hath
     been burnt herself, and therefore is able to kindle a whole green
     coppice."

     [415] Ed. 2. "dooth."

     [416] Stockado--a thrust in fencing.

     [417] Ed. 1. "Jason."

     [418] So in the _Scourge of Villainy_:
               "A crab's baked guts and lobster's butter'd thigh,
                I hear them swear is blood for venery."


     [419] Ox-pith is mentioned among other provocatives in John
     Taylor's _The Sculler_, ep. 32:--
              "Look how yon lecher's legs are worn away,
               With haunting of the whore-house every day!
               He knows more greasy panders, bawds and drabs,
               And eats more lobsters, artichokes and crabs,
               Blue roasted eggs, potatoes, muscadine,
               Oysters, and _pith that grows i' the ox's chine_,
               With many drugs, compounds, and simples store,
               Which makes him have a stomach to a whore."

     [420] Omitted in ed. 2.

     [421] Omitted in ed. 2.

     [422] This speech is given to Bianca in ed. 2.

     [423] This speech was added in ed. 2.

     [424] Ed. 2. "be with thee."

     [425] The first line of an old ballad (printed in Percy's
     _Reliques_). Falstaff is introduced humming a snatch of it
     in _2 Henry IV._, ii. 4.

     [426] Drunken.

     [427] The line is corrupt. Old eds. "slaues I fauour, I marry
     shall he rise."--Dyce reads "The slave's in favour: ay, marry,
     shall he rise."

     [428] Ed. 1. "mount."

     [429] "Why, when? ... cuckold" (ll. 57-71).--This passage was
     added in ed. 2.

     [430] A common exclamation of impatience.

     [431] The passage is very corrupt. Old eds. read:--
        "'Tis requisite, the parts [ed. 2. _partes_] with piety,
          And soft [ed. 2. and some copies of ed. 1. _loft_]
            respect forbeares, be closely dogg'd," &c.

     Dyce's emendation is:--
        "'Tis requisite the parties with piety
          And soft respect ever be closely dogg'd."

     W. N. Lettsom proposed:--
                                    "It must be so, for where
          Great states revenge, 'tis requisite the parties
          With spy of close respect be closely dogg'd."

     [432] Ed. 1. "disseuer."

     [433] Ed. 1. "discouered."

     [434] Old eds. "_Mend._"

     [435] Wrinkles.

     [436] Ed. 2. "noble."

     [437] Ironical exclamation.

     [438] Uncover.--"Descouvrir. To discover, uncover, _unhill_,
     denude, &c."--_Cotgrave._


                             SCENE III.

                 _A chamber in the Duke's Palace._

     _Enter_ MAQUERELLE, EMILIA, _and_ BIANCA, _with a posset_.

  _Maq._ Even here it is, three curds in three regions
  individually distinct, most methodically[439] according to
  art compos'd, without any drink.

  _Bian._ Without any drink!

  _Maq._ Upon my honour. Will ye sit and eat?

  _Emil._ Good, the composure: the receipt, how is't?

  _Maq._ 'Tis a pretty pearl; by this pearl (how does't
  with me?) thus it is. Seven and thirty yolks of Barbary
  hens' eggs; eighteen spoonfuls and a half of the
  juice of cock-sparrow bones; one ounce, three drams,
  four scruples, and one quarter of the syrup of Ethiopian
  dates; sweetened with three quarters of a pound of pure
  candied Indian eringoes; strewed over with the powder
  of pearl of America, amber of Cataia, and lamb-stones
  of Muscovia.                                                     15

  _Bian._ Trust me, the ingredients are very cordial, and,
  no question, good, and most powerful in restauration.[440]

  _Maq._ I know not what you mean by restauration;
  but this it doth,--it purifieth the blood, smootheth the
  skin, enliveneth the eye, strengtheneth the veins, mundifieth
  the teeth, comforteth the stomach, fortifieth the
  back, and quickeneth the wit; that's all.                        22

  _Emil._ By my troth, I have eaten but two spoonfuls,
  and methinks I could discourse most swiftly and wittily
  already.

  _Maq._ Have you the art to seem honest?

  _Bian._ Ay, thank advice and practice.                           27

  _Maq._ Why, then, eat me o' this posset, quicken your
  blood, and preserve your beauty. Do you know Doctor
  Plaster-face? by this curd, he is the most exquisite in
  forging of veins, sprightening of eyes, dying of hair,
  sleeking of skins, blushing of cheeks, surphling[441] of
  breasts, blanching and bleaching of teeth, that ever made
  an old lady gracious by torchlight; by this curd, la.

  _Bian._ Well,[442] we are resolved, what God has given us
  we'll cherish.                                                   36

  _Maq._ Cherish anything saving your husband; keep
  him not too high, lest he leap the pale: but, for your
  beauty, let it be your saint; bequeath two hours to it
  every morning in your closet. I ha' been young, and
  yet, in my conscience, I am not above five-and-twenty:
  but, believe me, preserve and use your beauty; for youth
  and beauty once gone, we are like bee-hives without
  honey, out-o'-fashion apparel that no man will wear:
  therefore use me your beauty.                                    45

  _Emil._ Ay, but men say--

  _Maq._ Men say! let men say what they will: life o'
  woman! they are ignorant of our[443] wants. The more in
  years, the more in perfection they grow; if they lose
  youth and beauty, they gain wisdom and discretion: but
  when our beauty fades, good-night with us. There cannot
  be an uglier thing than to see an old woman: from
  which, O pruning, pinching, and painting, deliver all
  sweet beauties!                                                  54

                                                     [_Music within._

  _Bian._ Hark! music!

  _Maq._ Peace, 'tis i' the duchess' bed-chamber.
  Good rest, most prosperously-graced ladies.

  _Emil._ Good night, sentinel.

  _Bian._ Night, dear Maquerelle.

  _Maq._ May my posset's operation send you my wit
  and honesty; and me, your youth and beauty: the
  pleasingest rest!                                                62

                         [_Exeunt, at one door_, BIANCA _and_ EMILIA;
                             _at another_ MAQUERELLE.

                          _A Song within._

  _Whilst the song is singing, enter_ MENDOZA _with his sword drawn,
   standing ready to murder_ FERNEZE _as he flies from the duchess'
                     chamber.--Tumult within._

  [_Within._] Strike, strike!

  [_Aur. within._] Save my Ferneze! O, save my Ferneze!

  [_Within._] Follow, pursue!

  [_Aur. within._] O, save Ferneze!

        _Enter_ FERNEZE _in his shirt, and is received upon_
                         MENDOZA'S _sword_.

  _Men._ Pierce, pierce!--Thou shallow fool, drop there!

                                    [_Thrusts his rapier in_ FERNEZE.

  He that attempts a princess' lawless love
  Must have broad hands, close heart, with Argus' eyes,
  And back of Hercules, or else he dies.                           70

         _Enter_ AURELIA, PIETRO, FERRARDO, BILIOSO, CELSO,
                           _and_ EQUATO.

  _All._ Follow, follow!

  _Men._ Stand off, forbear, ye most uncivil lords!

  _Pietro._ Strike!

  _Men._ Do not; tempt not a man resolv'd:

                    [MENDOZA _bestrides the wounded body of_ FERNEZE,
                        _and seems to save him_.

  Would you, inhuman murderers, more than death?

  _Aur._ O poor Ferneze!

  _Men._ Alas, now all defence too late!

  _Aur._ He's dead.

  _Pietro._ I am sorry for our shame.--Go to your bed:
  Weep not too much, but leave some tears to shed
  When I am dead.                                                  81

  _Aur._ What, weep for thee! my soul no tears shall find.

  _Pietr._ Alas, alas, that women's souls are blind!

  _Men._ Betray such beauty!
  Murder such youth! contemn civility!
  He loves him not that rails not at him.

  _Pietro._ Thou canst not move us: we have blood enough.--
  And please you, lady, we have quite forgot
  All your defects: if not, why, then--

  _Aur._ Not.

  _Pietro._ Not: the best of rest: good-night.                     90

                                  [_Exeunt_ PIETRO, FERRARDO, BILIOSO,
                                       CELSO, _and_ EQUATO.

  _Aur._ Despite go with thee!

  _Men._ Madam, you ha' done me foul disgrace; you
  have wronged him much loves you too much: go to,
  your soul knows you have.

  _Aur._ I think I have.

  _Men._ Do you but think so?

  _Aur._ Nay, sure, I have: my eyes have witnessed thy
  love: thou hast stood too firm for me.

  _Men._ Why, tell me, fair-cheeked lady, who even in
  tears art powerfully beauteous, what unadvised passion
  struck ye into such a violent heat against me? Speak,
  what mischief wronged us? what devil injured us?
  speak.                                                          103

  _Aur._ The thing ne'er worthy of the name of man, Ferneze;
  Ferneze swore thou lov'[d]st Emilia;
  Which to advance, with most reproachful breath
  Thou both didst blemish and denounce my love.

  _Men._ Ignoble villain! did I for this bestride
  Thy wounded limbs? for[444] this, rank opposite
  Even to my sovereign? for this, O God, for this,                110
  Sunk all my hopes, and with my hopes my life?
  Ripp'd bare my throat unto the hangman's axe?--
  Thou most dishonoured trunk!--Emilia!
  By life, I know her not--Emilia!--
  Did you believe him?

  _Aur._ Pardon me, I did.

  _Men._ Did you? and thereupon you grac�d him?

  _Aur._ I did.

  _Men._ Took him to favour, nay, even clasp'd with him?

  _Aur._ Alas, I did!

  _Men._ This night?                                              120

  _Aur._ This night.

  _Men._ And in your lustful twines the duke took you?

  _Aur._ A most sad truth.

  _Men._ O God, O God! how we dull honest souls,
  Heavy-brain'd men, are swallow'd in the bogs
  Of a deceitful ground! whilst nimble bloods,
  Light-jointed spirits speed;[445] cut good men's throats,
  And 'scape. Alas, I am too honest for this age,
  Too full of fleam and heavy steadiness;
  Stood still whilst this slave cast a noose about me;            130
  Nay, then to stand in honour of him and her,
  Who had even slic'd my heart!

  _Aur._ Come, I did err,
  And am most sorry I did err.

  _Men._ Why, we are both but dead: the duke hates us;
  And those whom princes do once groundly hate,
  Let them provide to die, as sure as fate.
  Prevention is the heart of policy.

  _Aur._ Shall we murder him?

  _Men._ Instantly?

  _Aur._ Instantly; before he casts a plot,                       140
  Or further blaze my honour's much-known blot,
  Let's murder him.

  _Men._ I would do much for you: will ye marry me?

  _Aur._ I'll make thee duke. We are of Medicis;
  Florence our friend; in court my faction
  Not meanly strengthful; the duke then dead;
  We well prepar'd for change; the multitude
  Irresolutely reeling; we in force;
  Our party seconded; the kingdom maz'd;
  No doubt of swift success all shall be grac'd.                  150

  _Men._ You do confirm me; we are resolute:
  To-morrow look for change; rest confident.
  'Tis now about the immodest waist of night:
  The mother of moist dew with pallid light
  Spreads gloomy shades about the numb�d earth.
  Sleep, sleep, whilst we contrive our mischief's birth.
  This man I'll get inhum'd. Farewell: to bed;
  Ay, kiss thy[446] pillow, dream the duke is dead.
  So, so, good night.

                                                     [_Exit_ AURELIA.

                    How fortune dotes on impudence!
  I am in private the adopted son                                 160
  Of yon good prince:
  I must be duke; why, if I must, I must.
  Most silly lord, name me! O heaven! I see
  God made honest fools to maintain crafty knaves.
  The duchess is wholly mine too; must kill her husband
  To quit her shame; much![447] then marry her: ay.
  O, I grow proud in prosperous treachery!
  As wrestlers clip, so I'll embrace you all,
  Not to support, but to procure your fall.

                         _Enter_ MALEVOLE.


  _Mal._ God arrest thee!                                         170

  _Men._ At whose suit?

  _Mal._ At the devil's. Ah, you treacherous, damnable
  monster, how dost? how dost, thou treacherous rogue?
  Ah, ye rascal! I am banished the court, sirrah.

  _Men._ Prithee, let's be acquainted; I do love thee,
  faith.

  _Mal._ At your service, by the Lord, la: shall's go to
  supper? Let's be once drunk together, and so unite a
  most virtuously-strengthened friendship: shall's, Huguenot?
  shall's?                                                        180

  _Men._ Wilt fall upon my chamber to-morrow morn?

  _Mal._ As a raven to a dunghill. They say there's one
dead here; pricked for the pride of the flesh.

  _Men._ Ferneze: there he is; prithee, bury him.

  _Mal._ O, most willingly: I mean to turn pure Rochelle[448]
  churchman, I.

  _Men._ Thou churchman! why, why?

  _Mal._ Because I'll live lazily, rail upon authority, deny
  kings' supremacy in things indifferent, and be a pope in
  mine own parish.                                                190

  _Men._ Wherefore dost thou think churches were made?

  _Mal._ To scour plough-shares: I ha'[449] seen oxen plough
  up altars; _et nunc seges ubi Sion fuit_.[450]

  _Men._ Strange!

  _Mal._ Nay, monstrous! I ha' seen a sumptuous steeple
  turned to a stinking privy; more beastly, the sacredest
  place made a dogs' kennel; nay, most inhuman, the
  stoned coffins of long-dead Christians burst up, and made
  hogs' troughs: _hic finis Priami_.[451] Shall I ha' some sack
  and cheese at thy chamber? Good night, good mischievous
  incarnate devil; good night, Mendoza; ah, ye
  inhuman villain, good night! night, fub.                        202

  _Men._ Goodnight: to-morrow morn?

  _Mal._ Ay, I will come, friendly damnation, I will come.
  [_Exit_ MENDOZA.] I do descry cross-points; honesty and
  courtship straddle as far asunder as a true Frenchman's
  legs.

  _Fer._ O!

  _Mal._ Proclamations! more proclamations!

  _Fer._ O! a surgeon!                                            210

  _Mal._ Hark! lust cries for a surgeon. What news from
  Limbo? how does[452] the grand cuckold, Lucifer?

  _Fer._ O, help, help! conceal and save me.

                       [FERNEZE _stirs, and_ MALEVOLE _helps him up_.

  _Mal._ Thy shame more than thy wounds do grieve me far:
  Thy wounds but leave upon thy flesh some scar;
  But fame ne'er heals, still rankles worse and worse;
  Such is of uncontroll�d lust the curse.
  Think what it is in lawless sheets to lie;
  But, O Ferneze, what in lust to die!
  Then thou that shame respect'st, O, fly converse                220
  With women's eyes and lisping wantonness!
  Stick candles 'gainst a virgin wall's white back,
  If they not burn, yet at the least they'll black.
  Come, I'll convey thee to a private port,
  Where thou shalt live (O happy man!) from court.
  The beauty of the day begins to rise,
  From whose bright form night's heavy shadow flies.
  Now 'gin close plots to work; the scene grows full,
  And craves his eyes who hath a solid skull.

                              SCENE I.

                   _A room in the Duke's Palace._

          _Enter_ PIETRO, MENDOZA, EQUATO, _and_ BILIOSO.

  _Pietro._ 'Tis grown to youth of day: how shall we waste
      this light?
  My heart's more heavy than a tyrant's crown.
  Shall we go hunt? Prepare for field.

                                                      [_Exit_ EQUATO.

  _Men._ Would ye could be merry!

  _Pietro._ Would God I could! Mendoza, bid 'em haste.

                                                     [_Exit_ MENDOZA.

  I would fain shift place; O vain relief!
  Sad souls may well change place, but not change grief:
  As deer, being struck, fly thorough many soils,[453]
  Yet still the shaft sticks fast, so----

  _Bil._ A good old simile, my honest lord.                        10

  _Pietro._ I am not much unlike to some sick man
  That long desir�d hurtful drink; at last
  Swills in and drinks his last, ending at once
  Both life and thirst. O, would I ne'er had known
  My own dishonour! Good God, that men should desire
  To search out that, which, being found, kills all
  Their joy of life! to taste the tree of knowledge,
  And then be driven from out paradise!--
  Canst give me some comfort?                                      19

  _Bil._ My lord, I have some books which have been
  dedicated to my honour, and I ne'er read 'em, and yet
  they had very fine names, _Physic for Fortune_,[454] _Lozenges
  of sanctified sincerity_,[455] very pretty works of curates,
  scriveners, and schoolmasters. Marry, I remember one
  Seneca, Lucius Ann�us Seneca----

  _Pietro._ Out upon him! he writ of temperance and
  fortitude, yet lived like a voluptuous epicure, and died
  like an effeminate coward.--Haste thee to Florence:
  Here, take our letters; see 'em seal'd: away!
  Report in private to the honour'd duke                           30
  His daughter's forc'd disgrace; tell him at length
  We know too much: due compliments[456] advance:
  There's naught that's safe and sweet but ignorance.[457]

                                                             [_Exit._

                          _Enter_ BIANCA.

  _Bil._ Madam, I am going ambassador for Florence;
  'twill be great charges to me.

  _Bian._ No matter, my lord, you have the lease of two
  manors come out next Christmas; you may lay your
  tenants on the greater rack for it: and when you come
  home again, I'll teach you how you shall get two hundred
  pounds a-year by your teeth.                                     40

  _Bil._ How, madam?

  _Bian._ Cut off so much from house-keeping: that
  which is saved by the teeth, you know, is got by the
  teeth.

  _Bil._ 'Fore God, and so I may; I am in wondrous
  credit, lady.

  _Bian._ See the use of flattery: I did ever counsel you
  to flatter greatness, and you have profited well: any
  man that will do so shall be sure to be like your Scotch
  barnacle,[458] now a block, instantly a worm, and presently a
  great goose: this it is to rot and putrefy in the bosom of
  greatness.                                                       52

  _Bil._ Thou art ever my politician. O, how happy is
  that old lord that hath a politician to his young lady!
  I'll have fifty gentlemen shall attend upon me: marry,
  the most of them shall be farmers' sons, because they
  shall bear their own charges; and they shall go apparelled
  thus,--in sea-water-green suits, ash-colour cloaks, watchet
  stockings, and popinjay-green feathers: will not the
  colours do excellent?                                            60

  _Bian._ Out upon't! they'll look like citizens riding to
  their friends at Whitsuntide; their apparel just so many
  several parishes.

  _Bil._ I'll have it so; and Passarello, my fool, shall go
  along with me; marry, he shall be in velvet.

  _Bian._ A fool in velvet!

  _Bil._ Ay, 'tis common for your fool to wear satin; I'll
  have mine in velvet.

  _Bian._ What will you wear, then, my lord?                       69

  _Bil._ Velvet too; marry, it shall be embroidered,
  because I'll differ from the fool somewhat. I am horribly
  troubled with the gout: nothing grieves me, but that
  my doctor hath forbidden me wine, and you know your
  ambassador must drink. Didst thou ask thy doctor what
  was good for the gout?

  _Bian._ Yes; he said, ease, wine, and women, were good
  for it.

  _Bil._ Nay, thou hast such a wit! What was good to
  cure it, said he?                                                79

  _Bian._ Why, the rack. All your empirics could never
  do the like cure upon the gout the rack did in England,
  or your Scotch boot.[459] The French harlequin[460] will
  instruct you.

  _Bil._ Surely, I do wonder how thou, having for the
 instructmost part of thy lifetime been a country body, shouldst
 instructhave so good a wit.

  _Bian._ Who, I? why, I have been a courtier thrice two
 instructmonths.                                                   88

  _Bil._ So have I this twenty year, and yet there was a
 instructgentleman-usher called me coxcomb t'other day, and to
 instructmy face too: was't not a backbiting rascal? I would I
 instructwere better travelled, that I might have been better
 instructacquainted with the fashions of several countrymen: but
 instructmy secretary, I think, he hath sufficiently instructed me.

  _Bian._ How, my lord?

  _Bil._ "Marry, my good lord," quoth he, "your lordship
 instructshall ever find amongst a hundred Frenchmen forty
 instructhot-shots; amongst a hundred Spaniards, three-score
 instructbraggarts; amongst a hundred Dutchmen, four-score
 instructdrunkards; amongst an hundred Englishmen, four-score
 instructand ten madmen; and amongst an hundred Welshmen"----     102

  _Bian._ What, my lord?

  _Bil._ "Four-score and nineteen gentlemen."[461]

  _Bian._ But since you go about a sad embassy, I would
 instructhave you go in black, my lord.

  _Bil._ Why, dost think I cannot mourn, unless I wear
  my hat in cipres,[462] like an alderman's heir? that's vile,
  instruct very old, in faith.

  _Bian._ I'll learn of you shortly: O, we should have a
  fine gallant of you, should not I instruct you! How will
  you bear yourself when you come into the Duke of
  Florence' court?                                                113

  _Bil._ Proud enough, and 'twill do well enough: as I
  walk up and down the chamber, I'll spit frowns about
  me, have a strong perfume in my jerkin, let my beard
  grow to make me look terrible, salute no man beneath
  the fourth button; and 'twill do excellent.

  _Bian._ But there is a very beautiful lady there; how
  will you entertain her?                                         120

  _Bil._ I'll tell you that, when the lady hath entertained
  me: but to satisfy thee, here comes the fool.

                        _Enter_ PASSARELLO.

  Fool, thou shalt stand for the fair lady.

  _Pass._ Your fool will stand for your lady most willingly
  and most uprightly.

  _Bil._ I'll salute her in Latin.

  _Pass._ O, your fool can understand no Latin.

  _Bil._ Ay, but your lady can.

  _Pass._ Why, then, if your lady take down your fool, your
  fool will stand no longer for your lady.                        130

  _Bil._ A pestilent fool! 'fore God, I think the world
  be turned upside down too.

  _Pass._ O, no, sir; for then your lady and all the ladies
  in the palace should go with their heels upward, and that
  were a strange sight, you know.

  _Bil._ There be many will repine at my preferment.

  _Pass._ O, ay, like the envy of an elder sister, that hath
  her younger made a lady before her.

  _Bil._ The duke is wondrous discontented.

  _Pass._ Ay, and more melancholic than a usurer having
  all his money out at the death of a prince.                     141

  _Bil._ Didst thou see Madam Floria to-day?

  _Pass._ Yes, I found her repairing her face to-day; the
  red upon the white showed as if her cheeks should have
  been served in for two dishes of barberries in stewed
  broth, and the flesh to them a woodcock.

  _Bil._ A bitter fool![463]--Come, madam, this night thou
  shalt enjoy me freely, and to-morrow for Florence.              148

  _Pass._ What a natural fool is he that would be a pair
  of boddice to a woman's petticoat, to be trussed and
  pointed to them! Well, I'll dog my lord; and the word
  is proper: for when I fawn upon him, he feeds me; when
  I snap him by the fingers, he spits in my mouth. If a
  dog's death were not strangling, I had rather be one
  than a serving-man; for the corruption of coin is either
  the generation of a usurer or a lousy beggar.

                                   [_Exeunt_ BIANCA _and_ PASSARELLO.

       _Enter_ MALEVOLE _in some frize gown, whilst_ BILIOSO
                        _reads his patent_.

  _Mal._ I cannot sleep; my eyes' ill-neighbouring lids
  Will hold no fellowship. O thou pale sober night,
  Thou that in sluggish fumes all sense dost steep;
  Thou that giv'st all the world full leave to play,              160
  Unbend'st the feebled veins of sweaty labour!
  The galley-slave, that all the toilsome day
  Tugs at his oar against the stubborn wave,
  Straining his rugged veins, snores fast;
  The stooping scythe-man, that doth barb the field,
  Thou mak'st wink sure: in night all creatures sleep;
  Only the malcontent, that 'gainst his fate
  Repines and quarrels,--alas, he's goodman tell-clock!
  His sallow jaw-bones sink with wasting moan;
  Whilst others' beds are down, his pillow's stone.               170

  _Bil._ Malevole!

  _Mal._ Elder of Israel, thou honest defect of wicked
  nature and obstinate ignorance, when did thy wife let
  thee lie with her?

  _Bil._ I am going ambassador to Florence.

  _Mal._ Ambassador! Now, for thy country's honour,
  prithee, do not put up mutton and porridge i' thy cloakbag.
  Thy young lady wife goes to Florence with thee
  too, does she not?

  _Bil._ No, I leave her at the palace.                           180

  _Mal._ At the palace! Now, discretion shield, man;
  for God's love, let's ha' no more cuckolds! Hymen
  begins to put off his saffron[464] robe: keep thy wife i' the
  state of grace. Heart o' truth, I would sooner leave my
  lady singled in a bordello than in the Genoa palace:
  Sin there appearing in her sluttish shape,
  Would soon grow loathsome, even to blushes' sense;
  Surfeit would choke[465] intemperate appetite,
  Make the soul scent the rotten breath of lust.
  When in an Italian lascivious palace,                           190
  A lady guardianless,
  Left to the push of all allurement,
  The strongest incitements to immodesty,
  To have her bound, incens'd with wanton sweets,
  Her veins fill'd high with heating delicates,
  Soft rest, sweet music, amorous masquerers,
  Lascivious banquets, sin itself gilt o'er,
  Strong fantasy tricking up strange delights,
  Presenting it dress'd pleasingly to sense,
  Sense leading it unto the soul, confirm'd                       200
  With potent examples impudent custom,
  Entic'd by that great bawd, opportunity;[466]
  Thus being prepar'd, clap to her easy ear
  Youth in good clothes, well-shap'd, rich,
  Fair-spoken, promising, noble, ardent, blood-full,
  Witty, flattering,--Ulysses absent,
  O Ithaca,[467] can chastest Penelope hold out?

  _Bil._ Mass, I'll think on't. Farewell.

  _Mal._ Farewell. Take thy wife with thee. Farewell.

                                                     [_Exit_ BILIOSO.

  To Florence; um! it may prove good, it may;                     210
  And we may once unmask our brows.

                           _Enter_ CELSO.

  _Celso._ My honour'd lord,--

  _Mal._ Celso, peace! how is't? speak low: pale fears
  Suspect that hedges, walls, and trees, have ears:
  Speak, how runs all?

  _Celso._ I'faith, my lord, that beast with many heads,
  The staggering multitude, recoils apace:
  Though thorough great men's envy, most men's malice,
  Their much-intemperate heat hath banish'd you,
  Yet now they find[468] envy and malice ne'er                    220
  Produce faint reformation.
  The duke, the too soft duke, lies as a block,
  For which two tugging factions seem to saw;
  But still the iron through the ribs they draw.

  _Mal._ I tell thee, Celso, I have ever found
  Thy breast most far from shifting cowardice
  And fearful baseness: therefore I'll tell thee, Celso,
  I find the wind begins to come about;
  I'll shift my suit of fortune.
  I know the Florentine, whose only force,                        230
  By marrying his proud daughter to this prince,
  Both banish'd me, and made this weak lord duke,
  Will now forsake them all; be sure he will:
  I'll lie in ambush for conveniency,
  Upon their severance to confirm myself.

  _Celso._ Is Ferneze interr'd?

  _Mal._ Of that at leisure: he lives.

  _Celso._ But how stands Mendoza? how is't with him?

  _Mal._ Faith, like a pair of snuffers, snibs[469] filth in other
  men, and retains it in himself.[470]                            240

  _Celso._ He does fly from public notice, methinks, as a
  hare does from hounds; the feet whereon he flies betray
  him.

  _Mal._ I can track him, Celso.
  O, my disguise fools him most powerfully!
  For that I seem a desperate malcontent,
  He fain would clasp with me: he's the true slave
  That will put on the most affected grace
  For some vile second cause.

  _Celso._ He's here.

  _Mal._ Give place.

                                                       [_Exit_ CELSO.

                          _Enter_ MENDOZA.

  Illo, ho, ho, ho! art there, old truepenny?[471] Where hast
  thou spent thyself this morning? I see flattery in thine
  eyes, and damnation in thy soul. Ha, ye[472] huge rascal!

  _Men._ Thou art very merry.                                     253

  _Mal._ As a scholar _futuens gratis_. How does[473] the
  devil go with thee now?

  _Men._ Malevole, thou art an arrant knave.

  _Mal._ Who, I? I have been a sergeant, man.

  _Men._ Thou art very poor.

  _Mal._ As Job, an alchymist, or a poet.

  _Men._ The duke hates thee.                                     260

  _Mal._ As Irishmen[474] do bum-cracks.

  _Men._ Thou hast lost his amity.

  _Mal._ As pleasing as maids lose their virginity.

  _Men._ Would thou wert of a lusty spirit! would thou
  wert noble!                                                     265

  _Mal._ Why, sure my blood gives me I am noble, sure
  I am of noble kind; for I find myself possessed with all
  their qualities;--love dogs, dice, and drabs, scorn wit in
  stuff-clothes; have beat my shoemaker, knocked my
  semstress, cuckold my pothecary, and undone my tailor.
  Noble! why not? since the stoic said, _Neminem servum
  non ex regibus, neminem regem non ex servis esse oriundum_;[475]
  only busy Fortune touses, and the provident Chances
  blend them together. I'll give you a simile: did you e'er
  see a well with two buckets, whilst one comes up full
  to be emptied, another goes down empty to be filled?
  such is the state of all humanity. Why, look you, I
  may be the son of some duke; for, believe me, intemperate
  lascivious bastardy makes nobility doubtful: I have
  a lusty daring heart, Mendoza.                                  280

  _Men._ Let's grasp; I do like thee infinitely: wilt enact
  one thing for me?

  _Mal._ Shall I get by it?             [MEN. _gives him his purse_.]
  Command me; I am thy slave, beyond death and hell.

  _Men._ Murder the duke.

  _Mal._ My heart's wish, my soul's desire, my fantasy's
  dream, my blood's longing, the only height of my hopes!
  How, O God, how! O, how my united spirits throng
  together, to[476] strengthen my resolve!

  _Men._ The duke is now a-hunting.                               290

  _Mal._ Excellent, admirable, as the devil would have it!
  Lend me, lend me, rapier, pistol, cross-bow: so, so, I'll
  do it.

  _Men._ Then we agree.

  _Mal._ As Lent and fishmongers. Come, a-cap-a-pe,
  how? inform.

  _Men._ Know that this weak-brain'd duke, who only stands
  On Florence' stilts, hath out of witless zeal
  Made me his heir, and secretly confirm'd
  The wreath to me after his life's full point.                   300

  _Mal._ Upon what merit?

  _Men._ Merit! by heaven, I horn him:
  Only Ferneze's death gave me state's life.
  Tut, we are politic, he must not live now.

  _Mal._ No reason, marry: but how must he die now?

  _Men._ My utmost project is to murder the duke, that
  I might have his state, because he makes me his heir;
  to banish the duchess, that I might be rid of a cunning
  Laced�monian, because I know Florence will forsake
  her; and then to marry Maria, the banished Duke
  Altofront's wife, that her friends might strengthen me
  and my faction: that is all, la.                                311

  _Mal._ Do you love Maria?

  _Men._ Faith, no great affection, but as wise men do
  love great women, to ennoble their blood and augment
  their revenue. To accomplish this now, thus now. The
  duke is in the forest next the sea: single him, kill him,
  hurl him i' the main, and proclaim thou sawest wolves
  eat him.

  _Mal._ Um! not so good. Methinks when he is slain,
  To get some hypocrite, some dangerous wretch                    320
  That's muffled o['e]r with feign�d holiness,
  To swear he heard the duke on some steep cliff
  Lament his wife's dishonour, and, in an agony
  Of his heart's torture, hurl'd his groaning sides
  Into the swollen sea,--this circumstance
  Well made sounds probable: and hereupon
  The duchess----

  _Men._ May well be banish'd:
  O unpeerable invention! rare!
  Thou god of policy! it honeys me.                               330

  _Mal._ Then fear not for the wife of Altofront;
  I'll close to her.

  _Men._ Thou shalt, thou shalt. Our excellency is pleas'd:
  Why wert not thou an emperor? when we
  Are duke, I'll make thee some great man, sure.

  _Mal._ Nay,
  Make me some rich knave, and I'll make myself
  Some great man.

  _Men._ In thee be all my spirit:
  Retain ten souls, unite thy virtual powers:
  Resolve; ha, remember greatness! heart, farewell:               340
  The fate of all my hopes in thee doth dwell.

                                                             [_Exit._

                         _Re-enter_ CELSO.

  _Mal._ Celso, didst hear?--O heaven, didst hear
  Such devilish mischief? suffer'st thou the world
  Carouse damnation even with greedy swallow,
  And still dost wink, still does thy vengeance slumber?
  If now thy brows are clear, when will they thunder?

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                      _A forest near the sea._

          _Enter_ PIETRO, FERRARDO, PREPASSO, _and_ Three
                               Pages.

  _Fer._ The dogs are at a fault.

                                        [_Cornets like horns within._

  _Pietro._ Would God nothing but the dogs were at it!
  Let the deer pursue safety,[477] the dogs follow the game,
  and do you follow the dogs: as for me, 'tis unfit one
  beast should hunt another; I ha' one chaseth me: an't[478]
  please you, I would be rid of ye a little.

  _Fer._ Would your grief would, as[479] soon as we, leave
  you to quietness!

  _Pietro._ I thank you.

                                   [_Exeunt_ FERRARDO _and_ PREPASSO.

  Boy, what dost thou dream of now?                                10

  _First Page._ Of a dry summer, my lord; for here's a
  hot world towards: but, my lord, I had a strange dream
  last night.

  _Pietro._ What strange dream?

  _First Page._ Why, methought I pleased you with
  singing, and then I dreamt that you gave me that short
  sword.

  _Pietro._ Prettily begged: hold thee, I'll prove thy
  dream true; take't.

                                                     [_Giving sword._

  _First Page._ My duty: but still I dreamt on, my lord;
  and methought, an't[478] shall please your excellency, you
  would needs out of your royal bounty give me that jewel
  in your hat.                                                     23

  _Pietro._ O, thou didst but dream, boy; do not believe
  it: dreams prove not always true; they may hold in a
  short sword, but not in a jewel. But now, sir, you
  dreamt you had pleased me with singing; make that
  true, as I ha' made the other.

  _First Page._ Faith, my lord, I did but dream, and
  dreams, you say, prove not always true; they may hold
  in a good sword, but not in a good song: the truth is, I
  ha' lost my voice.                                               32

  _Pietro._ Lost thy voice! how?

  _First Page._ With dreaming, faith: but here's a couple
  of sirenical rascals shall enchant ye: what shall they
  sing, my good lord?

  _Pietro._ Sing of the nature of women; and then the
  song shall be surely full of variety, old crotchets, and
  most sweet closes: it shall be humorous, grave, fantastic,
  amorous, melancholy, sprightly, one in all, and all in
  one.                                                             41

  _First Page._ All in one!

  _Pietro._ By'r lady, too many. Sing: my speech grows
  culpable of unthrifty idleness: sing. Ah, so, so, sing.

                _Song by_ Second _and_ Third Pages.

  I am heavy: walk off; I shall talk in my sleep: walk
  off.

                                                     [_Exeunt_ Pages.

  _Enter_ MALEVOLE, _with cross-bow and pistol_.


  _Mal._ Brief, brief: who? the duke! good heaven, that fools
  Should stumble upon greatness!--Do not sleep, duke;
  Give ye good-morrow: I[480] must be brief, duke;
  I am fee'd to murder thee: start not: Mendoza,                   50
  Mendoza hir'd me; here's his gold, his pistol,
  Cross-bow, and[481] sword: 'tis all as firm as earth.
  O fool, fool, chok�d with the common maze
  Of easy idiots, credulity!
  Make him thine heir! what, thy sworn murderer!

  _Pietro._ O, can it be?

  _Mal._ Can!

  _Pietro._ Discover'd he not Ferneze?

  _Mal._ Yes, but why? but why? for love to thee?
  Much, much![482] to be reveng'd upon his rival,
  Who had thrust his jaws awry;
  Who being slain, suppos'd by thine own hands,                    60
  Defended by his sword, made thee most loathsome,
  Him most gracious with thy loose princess:
  Thou, closely yielding egress and regress to her,
  Madest him heir; whose hot unquiet lust
  Straight tous'd thy sheets, and now would seize thy state.
  Politician! wise man! death! to be
  Led to the stake like a bull by the horns;
  To make even kindness cut a gentle throat!
  Life, why art thou numb'd? thou foggy dulness, speak:
  Lives not more faith in a home-thrusting tongue                  70
  Than in these fencing tip-tap courtiers?

  _Enter_ CELSO, _with a hermit's gown and beard_.

  _Pietro._[483] Lord Malevole, if this be true----

  _Mal._ If! come, shade thee with this disguise. If!
  thou shalt handle it; he shall thank thee for killing thyself.
  Come, follow my directions, and thou shalt see
  strange sleights.

  _Pietro._ World, whither wilt thou?

  _Mal._ Why, to the devil. Come, the morn grows late:
  A steady quickness is the soul of state.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                               ACT IV.


                              SCENE I.

                       _Palace of the Duke._

                         Enter MAQUERELLE.

  _Maq._ [_Knocking at the ladies' door._] Medam, medam,
  are you stirring, medam? if you be stirring, medam,--if
  I thought I should disturb ye--

                           _Enter_ Page.

  _Page._ My lady is up, forsooth.

  _Maq._ A pretty boy, faith: how old art thou?

  _Page._ I think fourteen.

  _Maq._ Nay, an ye be in the teens--are ye a gentleman
  born? do you know me? my name is Medam Maquerelle;
  I lie in the old Cunny-court.

  [_Page._] See, here the ladies.                                  10

                   _Enter_ BIANCA _and_ EMILIA.

  _Bian._ A fair day to ye, Maquerelle.

  _Emil._ Is the duchess up yet, sentinel?

  _Maq._ O ladies, the most abominable mischance! O
  dear ladies, the most piteous disaster! Ferneze was
  taken last night in the duchess' chamber: alas, the duke
  catched him and killed him!

  _Bian._ Was he found in bed?                                     17

  _Maq._ O, no; but the villainous certainty is, the door
  was not bolted, the tongue-tied hatch held his peace: so
  the naked troth is, he was found in his shirt, whilst I,
  like an arrant beast, lay in the outward chamber, heard
  nothing; and yet they came by me in the dark, and yet
  I felt them not, like a senseless creature as I was. O
  beauties, look to your busk-points;[484] if not chastely, yet
  charily: be sure the door be bolted.--Is your lord gone
  to Florence?

  _Bian._ Yes, Maquerelle.                                         27

  _Maq._ I hope you'll find the discretion to purchase a
  fresh gown 'fore his return.--Now, by my troth, beauties,
  I would ha' ye once wise: he loves ye; pish! he is witty;
  bubble! fair-proportioned; mew! nobly-born; wind!
  Let this be still your fixed position; esteem me every
  man according to his good gifts, and so ye shall ever remain
  most worthy to be, most dear ladies.

  _Emil._ Is the duke returned from hunting yet?

  _Maq._ They say not yet.

  _Bian._ 'Tis now in midst of day.                                37

  _Emil._ How bears the duchess with this blemish now?

  _Maq._ Faith, boldly; strongly defies defame, as one
  that has a duke to her father. And there's a note to
  you: be sure of a stout friend in a corner, that may
  always awe your husband. Mark the behaviour of the
  duchess now: she dares defame; cries, "Duke, do what
  thou canst, I'll quit mine honour:" nay, as one confirmed
  in her own virtue against ten thousand mouths that
  mutter her disgrace, she's presently for dances.

  _Bian._ For dances!

  _Maq._ Most true.

  _Emil._ Most strange.

                         _Enter_ FERRARDO.

  See, here's my servant, young Ferrardo: how many servants
  thinkest thou I have, Maquerelle?                                51

  _Maq._ The more, the merrier: 'twas well said, use
  your servants as you do your smocks; have many, use
  one, and change often; for that's most sweet and court-like.

  _Fer._ Save ye, fair ladies! Is the duke return'd?

  _Bian._ Sweet sir, no voice of him as yet in court.

  _Fer._ 'Tis very strange.

  _Bian._ And how like you my servant, Maquerelle?                 59

  _Maq._ I think he could hardly draw Ulysses' bow; but,
  by my fidelity, were his nose narrower, his eyes broader,
  his hands thinner, his lips thicker, his legs bigger, his
  feet lesser, his hair blacker, and his teeth whiter, he were
  a tolerable sweet youth, i'faith. And he will come to my
  chamber, I will read him the fortune of his beard.

                                             [_Cornets sound within._

  _Fer._ Not yet returned! I fear--but the duchess
  approacheth.

        _Enter_ MENDOZA _supporting_ AURELIA _and_ GUERRINO:
         _the ladies that are on the stage rise_: FERRARDO
                  _ushers in_ AURELIA, _and then
              takes a lady to tread a measure_.[485]

  _Aur._ We will dance:--music!--we will dance.

  _Guer. Les quanto_[486] lady, _Pensez bien, Passa regis_, or
  _Bianca's brawl_?                                                70

  _Aur._ We have forgot the brawl.

  _Fer._ So soon? 'tis wonder.

  _Guer._ Why, 'tis but two singles on the left, two on
  the right, three doubles[487] forward, a traverse of six round:
  do this twice, three singles side, galliard trick-of-twenty,[488]
  coranto-pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken
  down, come up, meet, two doubles, fall back, and then
  honour.

  _Aur._ O D�dalus, thy maze! I have quite forgot it.

  _Maq._ Trust me, so have I, saving the falling-back, and
  then honour.                                                     81

  _Aur._ Music, music!

                         _Enter_ PREPASSO.

  _Prep._ Who saw the duke? the duke?

  _Aur._ Music!

                          _Enter_ EQUATO.

  _Equato._ The duke? is the duke returned?

  _Aur._ Music!

                          _Enter_ CELSO.

  _Celso._ The duke is either quite invisible, or else is not.

  _Aur._ We are not pleased with your intrusion upon
  our private retirement; we are not pleased: you have
  forgot yourselves.                                               90

                          _Enter a_ Page.

  _Celso._ Boy, thy master? where's the duke?

  _Page._ Alas, I left him burying the earth with his spread
  joyless limbs: he told me he was heavy, would sleep;
  bade[489] me walk off, for that the strength of fantasy oft
  made him talk[490] in his dreams. I straight obeyed, nor
  ever[491] saw him since: but wheresoe'er he is, he's sad.

  _Aur._ Music, sound high, as is our heart! sound high!

     _Enter_ MALEVOLE, _and_ PIETRO _disguised like an hermit_.

  _Mal._ The duke,--peace!--the duke is dead.

  _Aur._ Music!

  _Mal._ Is't music?                                              100

  _Men._ Give proof.

  _Fer._ How?

  _Celso._ Where?

  _Prep._ When?

  _Mal._ Rest in peace, as the duke does; quietly sit: for
  my own part, I beheld him but dead; that's all: marry,
  here's one can give you a more particular account of him.

  _Men._ Speak, holy father, nor let any brow
  Within this presence fright thee from the truth:
  Speak confidently and freely.

  _Aur._ We attend.                                               110

  _Pietro._ Now had the mounting sun's all-ripening wings
  Swept the cold sweat of night from earth's dank breast,
  When I, whom men call Hermit of the Rock,
  Forsook my cell, and clambered up a cliff,
  Against whose base the heady Neptune dash'd
  His high-curl'd brows; there 'twas I eas'd my limbs:
  When, lo! my entrails melted with the moan
  Some one, who far 'bove me was climb'd, did make--
  I shall offend.

  _Men._ Not.                                                     120

  _Aur._ On.

  _Pietro._ Methinks I hear him yet:--"O female faith!
  Go sow the ingrateful sand, and love a woman:
  And do I live to be the scoff of men?
  To be the[492] wittol-cuckold, even to hug
  My poison? Thou knowest, O truth!
  Sooner hard steel will melt with southern wind,
  A seaman's whistle calm the ocean,
  A town on fire be extinct with tears,
  Than women, vow'd to blushless impudence,                       130
  With sweet behaviour and soft minioning[493]
  Will turn from that where appetite is fix'd.
  O powerful blood! how thou dost slave their soul!
  I wash'd an Ethiop, who, for recompense,
  Sullied my name: and must I, then, be forc'd
  To walk, to live thus black? must! must! fie!
  He that can bear with must, he cannot die."
  With that, he sigh'd so[494] passionately deep,
  That the dull air even groan'd: at last he cries,
  "Sink shame in seas, sink deep enough!" so dies;                140
  For then I viewed his body fall, and souse[495]
  Into the foamy main. O, then I saw,
  That which methinks I see, it was the duke;
  Whom straight the nicer-stomach'd sea belch'd up:
  But then----

  _Mal._ Then came I in; but, 'las, all was too late!
  For even straight he sunk.

  _Pietro._ Such was the duke's sad fate.

  _Celso._ A better fortune to our Duke Mendoza!

                                                 [_Cornets flourish._

  _Men._ A guard, a guard!

                         _Enter a Guard._

                          We, full of hearty tears,
  For our good father's loss,
  (For so we well may call him
  Who did beseech your loves for our succession),
  Cannot so lightly over-jump his death
  As leave his woes revengeless.--Woman of shame,      [_To_ AURELIA.
  We banish thee for ever to the place
  From whence this good man comes; nor permit,
  On death, unto thy[496] body any ornament;
  But, base as was thy life, depart away.                         160

  _Aur._ Ungrateful!

  _Men._ Away!

  _Aur._ Villain, hear me!

  _Men._ Begone!

      [PREPASSO _and_ GUERRINO _lead away_ AURELIA _guarded_.

                                My lords,
  Address to public council; 'tis most fit:
  The train of fortune is borne up by wit.
  Away! our presence shall be sudden; haste.

               [_All depart, except_ MENDOZA, MALEVOLE, _and_ PIETRO.

  _Mal._ Now, you egregious devil! ha, ye murdering
  politician! how dost, duke? how dost look now? brave
  duke, i'faith.                                                  170

  _Men._ How did you kill him?

  _Mal._ Slatted[497] his brains out, then soused him in the
  briny sea.

  _Men._ Brained him, and drowned him too?

  _Mal._ O 'twas best, sure work; for he that strikes a
  great man, let him strike home, or else 'ware, he'll prove
  no man: shoulder not a huge fellow, unless you may be
  sure to lay him in the kennel.

  _Men._ A most sound brain-pan! I'll make you both
  emperors.                                                       180

  _Mal._ Make us Christians, make us Christians.

  _Men._ I'll hoist ye, ye shall mount.

  _Mal._ To the gallows, say ye? come:[498] _pr�mium incertum
  petit certum scelus_.[499] How stands the progress?

  _Men._ Here, take my ring unto the citadel;         [_Giving ring._
  Have entrance to Maria, the grave duchess
  Of banish'd Altofront. Tell her we love her;
  Omit no circumstance to grace our person: do't.

  _Mal._ I'll[500] make an excellent pander: duke, farewell;
  'dieu, adieu, duke.                                             190

  _Men._ Take Maquerelle with thee; for 'tis found
  None cuts a diamond but a diamond.

                                                     [_Exit_ MALEVOLE.

                                   Hermit,
  Thou art a man for me, my confessor:
  O thou selected spirit, born for my good!
  Sure thou wouldst make
  An excellent elder in a deform'd church.
  Come, we must be inward,[501] thou and I all one.

  _Pietro._ I am glad I was ordained for ye.

  _Men._ Go to, then; thou must know that Malevole is a
  strange villain; dangerous, very dangerous: you see how
  broad 'a speaks; a gross-jawed rogue: I would have thee
  poison him: he's like a corn upon my great toe, I cannot go
  for him; he must be cored out, he must. Wilt do't, ha?

  _Pietro._ Anything, anything.                                   204

  _Men._ Heart of my life! thus, then. To the citadel:
  Thou shalt consort with this Malevole;
  There being at supper, poison him: it shall be laid
  Upon Maria, who yields love or dies:
  Scud quick.[502]

  _Pietro._ Like lightning: good deeds crawl, but mischief
      flies.                                             [_Exit._ 210

                        _Re-enter_ MALEVOLE.

  _Mal._ Your devilship's ring has no virtue: the buff-captain,
  the sallow Westphalian gammon-faced zaza cries,
  "Stand out;" must have a stiffer warrant, or no pass
  into the castle of comfort.

  _Men._ Command our sudden letter.--Not enter! sha't:
  what place is there in Genoa but thou shalt? into my
  heart, into my very heart: come, let's love; we must love,
  we two, soul and body.

  _Mal._ How didst like the hermit? a strange hermit,
  sirrah.                                                         220

  _Men._ A dangerous fellow, very perilous:
  He must die.

  _Mal._ Ay, he must die.

  _Men._ Thou'st[503] kill him.
  We are wise; we must be wise.

  _Mal._ And provident.

  _Men._ Yea, provident: beware an hypocrite;
  A churchman once corrupted, O, avoid!
  A fellow that makes religion his stalking-horse,[504]
  He breeds a plague: thou shalt poison him.

  _Mal._ O, 'tis wondrous necessary: how?

  _Men._ You both go jointly to the citadel;
  There sup, there poison him: and Maria,                         230
  Because she is our opposite, shall bear
  The sad suspect; on which she dies or loves us.

  _Mal._ I run.                                              [_Exit._

  _Men._ We that are great, our sole self-good still moves us.
  They shall die both, for their deserts crave more
  Than we can recompense: their presence still
  Imbraids[505] our fortunes with beholdingness,
  Which we abhor; like deed, not doer: then conclude,
  They live not to cry out "Ingratitude!"
  One stick burns t'other, steel cuts steel alone:                240
  'Tis good trust few; but, O, 'tis best trust none!

                                                             [_Exit._

                             SCENE II.

                       _Court of the Palace._

        _Enter_ MALEVOLE _and_ PIETRO, _still disguised, at
                          several doors_.

  _Mal._ How do you? how dost, duke?

  _Pietro._ O, let
  The last day fall! drop, drop on[506] our curs'd heads!
  Let heaven unclasp itself, vomit forth flames:

  _Mal._ O, do not rave,[507] do not turn player; there's
[_Exit._more of them than can well live one by another already.
  What, art an infidel still?

  _Pietro._ I am amazed;[508] struck in a swown with wonder:
  I am commanded to poison thee--

  _Mal._ I am commanded to poison thee at supper--

  _Pietro._ At supper--

  _Mal._ In the citadel--

  _Pietro._ In the citadel.                                        10

  _Mal._ Cross capers! tricks! truth o' heaven! he[509]
  would discharge us as boys do eldern guns, one pellet to
  strike out another. Of what faith art now?

  _Pietro._ All is damnation; wickedness extreme:
  There is no faith in man.

  _Mal._ In none but usurers and brokers; they deceive
  no man: men take 'em for blood-suckers, and so they
  are. Now, God deliver me from my friends!

  _Pietro._ Thy friends!                                           19

  _Mal._ Yes, from my friends; for from mine enemies
  I'll deliver myself. O, cut-throat friendship is the rankest
  villainy! Mark this Mendoza; mark him for a villain:
  but heaven will send a plague upon him for a rogue.

  _Pietro._ O world!

  _Mal._ World! 'tis the only region of death, the greatest
  shop of the devil; the crudest prison of men, out of
  the which none pass without paying their dearest breath
  for a fee; there's nothing perfect in it but extreme, extreme
  calamity, such as comes yonder.

    _Enter_ AURELIA, _two halberts before and two after, supported
             by_ CELSO _and_ FERRARDO; AURELIA _in base
                         mourning attire_.

  _Aur._ To banishment! lead[510] on to banishment!                30

  _Pietro._ Lady, the blessedness of repentance to you!

  _Aur._ Why, why, I can desire nothing but death,
  Nor deserve anything but hell.
  If heaven should give sufficiency of grace
  To clear my soul, it would make heaven graceless:
  My sins would make the stock of mercy poor;
  O, they would tire[511] heaven's goodness to reclaim them!
  Judgment is just yet[512] from that vast villain;
  But, sure, he shall not miss sad punishment
  'Fore he shall rule.--On to my cell of shame!                    40

  _Pietro._ My cell 'tis, lady; where, instead of masks,
  Music, tilts, tourneys, and such court-like shows,
  The hollow murmur of the checkless winds
  Shall groan again; whilst the unquiet sea
  Shakes the whole rock with foamy battery.
  There usherless[513] the air comes in and out:
  The rheumy vault will force your eyes to weep,
  Whilst you behold true desolation:
  A rocky barrenness shall pain[514] your eyes,
  Where all at once one reaches where he stands,                   50
  With brows the roof, both walls with both his hands.

  _Aur._ It is too good.--Bless'd spirit of my lord,
  O, in what orb soe'er thy soul is thron'd,
  Behold me worthily most miserable!
  O, let the anguish of my contrite spirit
  Entreat some reconciliation!
  If not, O, joy, triumph in my just grief!
  Death is the end of woes and tears' relief.

  _Pietro._ Belike your lord not lov'd you, was unkind.

  _Aur._ O heaven!                                                 60

  As the soul loves[515] the body, so lov'd he:
  'Twas death to him to part my presence, heaven
  To see me pleas'd.
  Yet I, like to a wretch given o'er to hell,
  Brake all the sacred rites of marriage,
  To clip a base ungentle faithless villain;
  O God! a very pagan reprobate--
  What should I say? ungrateful, throws me out,
  For whom I lost soul, body, fame, and honour.
  But 'tis most fit: why should a better fate                      70
  Attend on any who forsake chaste sheets;
  Fly the embrace of a devoted heart,
  Join'd by a solemn vow 'fore God and man,
  To taste the brackish flood[516] of beastly lust
  In an adulterous touch? O ravenous immodesty!
  Insatiate impudence of appetite!
  Look, here's your end; for mark, what sap in dust,
  What good in sin,[517] even so much love in lust.
  Joy to thy ghost, sweet lord! pardon to me!

  _Celso._ 'Tis the duke's pleasure this night you rest in court.  80

  _Aur._ Soul, lurk in shades; run, shame, from brightsome skies:
  In night the blind man misseth not his eyes.

                        [_Exit with_ CELSO, FERRARDO, _and halberts_.

  _Mal._ Do not weep, kind cuckold: take comfort,
  man; thy betters have been beccos:[518] Agamemnon,
  emperor of all the merry Greeks, that tickled all the
  true Trojans, was a cornuto; Prince Arthur, that cut
  off twelve kings' beards, was a cornuto; Hercules,
  whose back bore up heaven, and got forty wenches with
  child in one night,--

  _Pietro._ Nay, 'twas fifty.                                        90

  _Mal._ Faith, forty's enow, o' conscience,--yet was a
  cornuto. Patience; mischief grows proud: be wise.

  _Pietro._ Thou pinchest too deep; art too keen upon
  me.

  _Mal._ Tut, a pitiful surgeon makes a dangerous sore:
  I'll tent thee to the ground. Thinkest I'll sustain myself
  by flattering thee, because thou art a prince? I had
  rather follow a drunkard, and live by licking up his vomit,
  than by servile flattery.

  _Pietro._ Yet great men ha' done 't.                            100

  _Mal._ Great slaves fear better than love, born naturally
  for a coal-basket;[519] though the common usher of princes'
  presence, Fortune, ha'[520] blindly given them better place.
  I am vowed to be thy affliction.

  _Pietro._ Prithee, be;
  I love much misery, and be thou son to me.

  _Mal._ Because you are an usurping duke.----

                          _Enter_ BILIOSO.

  Your lordship's well returned from Florence.

  _Bil._ Well returned, I praise my horse.

  _Mal._ What news from the Florentines?

  _Bil._ I will conceal the great duke's pleasure; only
  this was his charge: his pleasure is, that his daughter
  die; Duke Pietro be banished for banishing his blood's
  dishonour; and that Duke Altofront be re-accepted.
  This is all: but I hear Duke Pietro is dead.                    114

  _Mal._ Ay, and Mendoza is duke: what will you do?

  _Bil._ Is Mendoza strongest?

  _Mal._ Yet he is.

  _Bil._ Then yet I'll hold with him.

  _Mal._ But if that Altofront should turn straight again?

  _Bil._ Why, then, I would turn straight again.                  120
  'Tis good run still with him that has most might:
  I had rather stand with wrong, than fall with right.

  _Mal._[521] What religion will you be of now?

  _Bil._ Of the duke's religion,[522] when I know what it is.

  _Mal._ O Hercules!

  Bil. Hercules! Hercules was the son of Jupiter and
  Alcmena.

  _Mal._ Your lordship is a very wit-all.

  _Bil._ Wittal!

  _Mal._ Ay, all-wit.                                             130

  _Bil._ Amphitryo was a cuckold.

  _Mal._ Your lordship sweats; your young lady will get
  you a cloth for your old worship's brows.

                                                     [_Exit_ BILIOSO.

  Here's a fellow to be damned: this is his inviolable
  maxim,--flatter the greatest and oppress the least: a
  whoreson flesh-fly, that still gnaws upon the lean galled
  backs.

  _Pietro._ Why dost, then, salute him?                           138

  _Mal._ Faith,[523] as bawds go to church, for fashion' sake.
  Come, be not confounded; thou'rt but in danger to lose
  a dukedom. Think this:--this earth is the only grave
  and Golgotha wherein all things that live must rot; 'tis
  but the draught wherein the heavenly bodies discharge
  their corruption; the very muck-hill on which the
  sublunary orbs cast their excrements: man is the slime
  of this dung-pit, and princes are the governors of these
  men; for, for our souls, they are as free as emperors,
  all of one piece; there[524] goes but a pair of shears
  betwixt an emperor and the son of a bagpiper; only
  the dying, dressing, pressing, glossing, makes the difference.
  Now, what art thou like to lose?                                151

  A gaoler's office to keep men in bonds,
  Whilst toil and treason all life's good confounds.

  _Pietro._ I here renounce for ever regency:
  O Altofront, I wrong thee to supplant thy right,
  To trip thy heels up with a devilish sleight!
  For which I now from throne am thrown: world-tricks abjure;
  For vengeance though't[525] comes slow, yet it comes sure.
  O, I am chang'd! for here, 'fore the dread power,
  In true contrition, I do dedicate                               160
  My breath to solitary holiness,
  My lips to prayer, and my breast's care shall be,
  Restoring Altofront to regency.

  _Mal._ Thy vows are heard, and we accept thy faith.

                                             [_Undisguiseth himself._

                  _Re-enter_ FERNEZE _and_ CELSO.

  Banish amazement: come, we four must stand
  Full shock of fortune: be not so wonder-stricken.

  _Pietro._ Doth Ferneze live?

  _Fer._ For your pardon.

  _Pietro._ Pardon and love. Give leave to recollect
  My thoughts dispers'd in wild astonishment.
  My vows stand fix'd in heaven, and from hence                   170
  I crave all love and pardon.

  _Mal._ Who doubts of providence,
  That sees this change? a hearty faith to all!
  He needs must rise who[526] can no lower fall:
  For still impetuous vicissitude
  Touseth[527] the world; then let no maze intrude
  Upon your spirits: wonder not I rise;
  For who can sink that close can temporise?
  The time grows ripe for action: I'll detect
  My privat'st plot, lest ignorance fear suspect.
  Let's close to counsel, leave the rest to fate:                 180
  Mature discretion is the life of state.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                           SCENE I.[528]

                      _A room in the Palace._

                 _Enter_ BILIOSO _and_ PASSARELLO.

  _Bil._ Fool, how dost thou like my calf in a long
  stocking?

  _Pass._ An excellent calf, my lord.

  _Bil._ This calf hath been a reveller this twenty year.
  When Monsieur Gundi lay here ambassador, I could
  have carried a lady up and down at arm's end in a
  platter; and I can tell you, there were those at that time
  who, to try the strength of a man's back and his arm,
  would be coistered.[529] I have measured calves with most
  of the palace, and they come nothing near me; besides,
  I think there be not many armours in the arsenal will
  fit me, especially for the headpiece. I'll tell thee--           12

  _Pass._ What, my lord?

  _Bil._ I can eat stewed broth as it comes seething off
  the fire; or a custard as it comes reeking out of the
  oven; and I think there are not many lords can do it.
  A good pomander,[530] a little decayed in the scent; but
  six grains of musk, ground with rose-water, and tempered
  with a little civet, shall fetch her again presently.

  _Pass._ O, ay, as a bawd with aqua-vit�.                         20

  _Bil._ And, what, dost thou rail upon the ladies as thou
  wert wont?

  _Pass._ I were better roast a live cat, and might do it
  with more safety. I am as secret to [the] thieves as
  their painting. There's Maquerelle, oldest bawd and a
  perpetual beggar--did you never hear of her trick to
  be known in the city?

  _Bil._ Never.

  _Pass._ Why, she gets all the picture-makers to draw
  her picture; when they have done, she most courtly
  finds fault with them one after another, and never
  fetcheth them: they, in revenge of this, execute her in
  pictures as they do in Germany, and hang her in their
  shops: by this means is she better known to the stinkards
  than if she had been five times carted.                          35

  _Bil._ 'Fore God, an excellent policy.

  _Pass._ Are there any revels to-night, my lord?

  _Bil._ Yes.

  _Pass._ Good my lord, give me leave to break a fellow's
  pate that hath abused me.                                        40

  _Bil._ Whose pate?

  _Pass._ Young Ferrardo, my lord.

  _Bil._ Take heed, he's very valiant; I have known him
  fight eight quarrels in five days, believe it.

  _Pass._ O, is he so great a quarreller? why, then, he's an
  arrant coward.

  _Bil._ How prove you that?

  _Pass._ Why, thus. He that quarrels seeks to fight;
  and he that seeks to fight seeks to die; and he that seeks
  to die seeks never to fight more; and he that will quarrel,
  and seeks means never to answer a man more, I think
  he's a coward.                                                   52

  _Bil._ Thou canst prove anything.

  _Pass._ Anything but a rich knave; for I can flatter no
  man.

  _Bil._ Well, be not drunk, good fool: I shall see you
  anon in the presence.

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [528] This scene was added in ed. 2.

     [529] Reed suggests that this word may be derived from old Fr.
     _coisser_ (= incommoder) or _coiter_ (= presser, exciter). Nares
     explains _coistered_ to mean "coiled up into a small compass."

     [530] A ball of perfumed paste, worn round the neck or at the
     girdle.


                             SCENE II.

                       _Before the Citadel._

      _Enter, from opposite sides_, MALEVOLE _and_ MAQUERELLE,
                             _singing_.

  _Mal. The Dutchman for a drunkard_,--

  _Maq. The Dane for golden locks_,--

  _Mal. The Irishman for usquebaugh_,--

  _Maq. The Frenchman for the_ (----).

  _Mal._ O, thou art a blessed creature! had I a modest
  woman to conceal, I would put her to thy custody; for
  no reasonable creature would ever suspect her to be in
  thy company: ah, thou art a melodious Maquerelle,--thou
  picture of a woman, and substance of a beast!

                  _Enter_ PASSARELLO _with wine._

  _Maq._ O fool,[531] will ye be ready anon to go with me to
  the revels? the hall will be so pestered anon.                   11

  _Pass._ Ay, as the country is with attorneys.

  _Mal._ What hast thou there, fool?

  _Pass._ Wine; I have learned to drink since I went with
  my lord ambassador: I'll drink to the health of Madam
  Maquerelle.

  _Mal._ Why, thou wast wont to rail upon her.

  _Pass._ Ay; but since I borrowed money of her, I'll
  drink to her health now; as gentlemen visit brokers, or
  as knights send venison to the city, either to take up
  more money, or to procure longer forbearance.                    21

  _Mal._ Give me the bowl. I drink a health to Altofront,
  our deposed duke.                                        [_Drinks._

  _Pas._ I'll take it [_Drinks_]:--so. Now I'll begin a
  health to Madam Maquerelle.                              [_Drinks._

  _Mal._ Pooh! I will not pledge her.

  _Pass._ Why, I pledged your lord.

  _Mal._ I care not.

  _Pass._ Not pledge Madam Maquerelle! why, then,
  will I spew up your lord again with this fool's finger.          30

  _Mal._ Hold; I'll take it.                               [_Drinks._

  _Maq._ Now thou hast drunk my health, fool, I am
  friends with thee.

  _Pass._ Art? art?
       When Griffon[532] saw the reconcil�d quean
         Offering about his neck her arms to cast,
       He threw off sword and heart's malignant spleen,
         And lovely her below the loins embrac'd.--
  Adieu, Madam Maquerelle.                                  [_Exit._

  _Mal._ And how dost thou think o' this transformation
  of state now?                                                      41

  _Maq._ Verily, very well; for we women always note,
  the falling of the one is the rising of the other; some must
  be fat, some must be lean; some must be fools, and some
  must be lords; some must be knaves, and some must be
  officers; some must be beggars, some must be knights;
  some must be cuckolds, and some must be citizens. As
  for example, I have two court-dogs, the most fawning
  curs, the one called Watch, the other Catch: now I, like
  Lady Fortune, sometimes love this dog, sometimes raise
  that dog, sometimes favour Watch, most commonly fancy
  Catch. Now, that dog which I favour I feed; and he's
  so ravenous, that what I give he never chaws it, gulps it
  down whole, without any relish of what he has, but with
  a greedy expectation of what he shall have. The other
  dog now----                                                      56

  _Mal._ No more dog, sweet Maquerelle, no more dog.
  And what hope hast thou of the Duchess Maria? will
  she stoop to the duke's lure? will she come,[533] thinkest?

  _Maq._ Let me see, where's the sign now? ha' ye e'er a
  calendar? where's the sign, trow you?                            61

  _Mal._ Sign! why, is there any moment in that?

  _Maq._ O, believe me, a most secret power: look ye, a
  Chaldean or an Assyrian, I am sure 'twas a most sweet
  Jew, told me, court any woman in the right sign, you
  shall not miss. But you must take her in the right vein
  then; as, when the sign is in Pisces, a fishmonger's
  wife is very sociable; in Cancer, a precisian's wife is very
  flexible; in Capricorn, a merchant's wife hardly holds
  out; in Libra, a lawyer's wife is very tractable, especially
  if her husband be at the term; only in Scorpio 'tis very
  dangerous meddling. Has the duke sent any jewel, any
  rich stones?                                                     73

  _Mal._ Ay, I think those are the best signs to take a
  lady in.

                          _Enter_ Captain.

  By your favour, signior, I must discourse with the Lady
  Maria, Altofront's duchess; I must enter for the duke.

  _Capt._ She here shall give you interview: I received
  the guardship of this citadel from the good Altofront,
  and for his use I'll keep't, till I am of no use.                80

  _Mal._ Wilt thou? O heavens, that a Christian should
  be found in a buff-jerkin! Captain Conscience, I love
  thee, captain. We attend.

                                                     [_Exit_ Captain.

  And what hope hast thou of this duchess' easiness?

  _Maq._ 'Twill go hard, she was a cold creature ever;
  she hated monkeys, fools, jesters, and gentlemen-ushers
  extremely; she had the vile trick on't, not only to be
  truly modestly honourable in her own conscience, but
  she would avoid the least wanton carriage that might
  incur suspect; as, God bless me, she had almost brought
  bed-pressing out of fashion; I could scarce get a fine for
  the lease of a lady's favour once in a fortnight.                92

  _Mal._ Now, in the name of immodesty, how many
  maidenheads has thou brought to the block?

  _Maq._ Let me see: heaven forgive us our misdeeds!--Here's
  the duchess.

                   _Enter_ MARIA _with_ Captain.

  _Mal._ God bless thee, lady!

  _Maria._ Out of thy company!

  _Mal._ We have brought thee tender of a husband.

  _Maria._ I hope I have one already.                             100

  _Maq._ Nay, by mine honour, madam, as good ha' ne'er
  a husband as a banished husband; he's in another world
  now. I'll tell ye, lady, I have heard of a sect that maintained,
  when the husband was asleep the wife might
  lawfully entertain another man, for then her husband
  was as dead; much more when he is banished.

  _Maria._ Unhonest creature!

  _Maq._ Pish, honesty is but an art to seem so:
  Pray ye, what's honesty, what's constancy,
  But fables feign'd, odd old fools' chat, devis'd                110
  By jealous fools to wrong our liberty?

  _Mal._ Molly, he that loves thee is a duke, Mendoza;
  he will maintain thee royally, love thee ardently, defend
  thee powerfully, marry thee sumptuously, and keep thee,
  in despite of Rosicleer or Donzel del Phebo.[534] There's
  jewels: if thou wilt, so; if not, so.

  _Maria._ Captain, for God's love,[535] save poor wretchedness
  From tyranny of lustful insolence!
  Enforce me in the deepest dungeon dwell,
  Rather than here; here round about is hell.--                   120
  O my dear'st Altofront! where'er thou breathe,
  Let my soul sink into the shades beneath,
  Before I stain thine honour! 'tis[536] thou has't,
  And long as I can die, I will live chaste.

  _Mal._ 'Gainst him that can enforce how vain is strife!

  _Maria._ She that can be enforc'd has ne'er a knife:
  She that through force her limbs with lust enrolls,
  Wants Cleopatra's asps and Portia's coals.
  God amend you!                                                  129

                                                [_Exit with_ Captain.

  _Mal._ Now, the fear of the devil for ever go with
      thee!--Maquerelle,
  I tell thee, I have found an honest
  woman: faith, I perceive, when all is done, there is of
  women, as of all other things, some good, most bad;
  some saints, some sinners: for as nowadays no courtier
  but has his mistress, no captain but has his cockatrice,[537]
  no cuckold but has his horns, and no fool but has his
  feather; even so, no woman but has her weakness and
  feather too, no sex but has his--I can hunt the letter no
  farther.--[_Aside_] O God, how loathsome this toying is
  to me! that a duke should be forced to fool it! well,
  _stultorum plena sunt omnia_:[538] better play the fool lord
  than be the fool lord.--Now, where's your sleights,
  Madam Maquerelle?                                               143

  _Maq._ Why, are ye ignorant that 'tis said a squeamish
  affected niceness is natural to women, and that the
  excuse of their yielding is only, forsooth, the difficult
  obtaining? You must put her to't: women are flax, and
  will fire in a moment.

  _Mal._ Why, was the flax put into thy mouth, and yet
  thou--Thou set fire, thou inflame her!                          150

  _Maq._ Marry, but I'll tell ye now, you were too hot.

  _Mal._ The fitter to have inflamed the flax, woman.

  _Maq._ You were too boisterous, spleeny, for, indeed----

  _Mal._ Go, go, thou art a weak pandress: now I see,

  Sooner earth's fire heaven itself shall waste,
  Than all with heat can melt a mind that's chaste.

  Go: thou the duke's lime-twig! I'll make the duke turn
  thee out of thine office: what, not get one touch of hope,
  and had her at such advantage!                                  160

  Maq. Now, o' my conscience, now I think in my discretion,
  we did not take her in the right sign; the blood
  was not in the true vein, sure.

                                                             [_Exit._

                          _Enter_ BILIOSO.

  _Bil._ Make way[539] there! the duke returns from the
  enthronement.--Malevole,--

  _Mal._ Out, rogue!

  _Bil._ Malevole,--

  _Mal._ Hence, ye gross-jawed, peasantly--out, go![540]          168

  _Bil._ Nay, sweet Malevole, since my return I hear you
  are become the thing I always prophesied would be,--an
  advanced virtue, a worthily-employed faithfulness, a
  man o' grace, dear friend. Come; what! _Si quoties
  peccant homines_[541]--if as often as courtiers play the knaves,
  honest men should be angry--why, look ye, we must
  collogue[542] sometimes, forswear sometimes.

  _Mal._ Be damned sometimes.

  _Bil._ Right: _nemo omnibus horis sapit_; no man can be
  honest at all hours: necessity often depraves virtue.

  _Mal._ I will commend thee to the duke.

  _Bil._ Do: let us be friends, man.                              180

  _Mal._ And knaves, man.

  _Bil._ Right: let us prosper and purchase:[543] our lordships
  shall live, and our knavery be forgotten.

  _Mal._ He that by any ways gets riches, his means never
  shames him.

  _Bil._ True.

  _Mal._ For impudency and faithlessness are the main
  stays to greatness.

  _Bil._ By the Lord, thou art a profound lad.

  _Mal._ By the Lord, thou art a perfect knave: out, ye
  ancient damnation!                                              191

  _Bil._ Peace, peace! and thou wilt not be a friend to
  me as I am a knave, be not a knave to me as I am thy
  friend, and disclose me. Peace! cornets!

      _Enter_ PREPASSO and FERRARDO, _two_ Pages _with lights_,
           CELSO _and_ EQUATO, MENDOZA _in duke's robes,
                           and_ GUERRINO.

  _Men._ On, on; leave us, leave us.

                         [_Exeunt all except_ MALEVOLE _and_ MENDOZA.

  Stay, where is the hermit?

  _Mal._ With Duke Pietro, with Duke Pietro.

  _Men._ Is he dead? is he poisoned?

  _Mal._ Dead, as the duke is.

  _Men._ Good, excellent: he will not blab; secureness
  lives in secrecy. Come hither, come hither.                     201

  _Mal._ Thou hast a certain strong villainous scent about
  thee my nature cannot endure.

  _Men._ Scent, man! What returns Maria, what answer
  to our suit?

  _Mal._ Cold, frosty; she is obstinate.

  _Men._ Then she's but dead; 'tis resolute, she dies:
  Black deed only through black deed[544] safely flies.

  _Mal._ Pooh! _per scelera semper sceleribus tutum est iter_.[545]

  _Men._ What, art a scholar? art a politician? sure, thou
  art an arrant knave.                                            211

  _Mal._ Who, I? I ha' been twice an under-sheriff,
  man.[546] Well, I will go rail upon some great man, that I
  may purchase the bastinado, or else go marry some rich
  Genoan lady, and instantly go travel.

  _Men._ Travel, when thou art married?

  _Mal._ Ay, 'tis your young lord's fashion to do so,
  though he was so lazy, being a bachelor, that he would
  never travel so far as the university: yet when he
  married her, tales off, and, Catso,[547] for England!           220

  _Men._ And why for England?

  _Mal._ Because there is no brothel-houses there.

  _Men._ Nor courtezans?

  _Mal._ Neither; your whore went down with the stews,
  and your punk came up with your puritan.

  _Men._ Canst thou empoison? canst thou empoison?

  _Mal._ Excellently; no Jew, pothecary, or politician
  better. Look ye, here's a box: whom wouldst thou
  empoison? here's a box [_Giving it_], which, opened and
  the fume ta'en[548] up in conduits[549] thorough which the
  brain purges itself, doth instantly for twelve hours' space
  bind up all show of life in a deep senseless sleep: here's
  another [_Giving it_], which, being opened under the
  sleeper's nose, chokes all the pores[550] of life, kills him
  suddenly.                                                       235

  _Men._ I'll try experiments; 'tis good not to be deceived.--So,
  so; catso!                [_Seems to poison_ MALEVOLE,_ who falls._
         Who would fear that may destroy?
           Death hath no teeth nor[551] tongue;
         And he that's great, to him are slaves,                  240
           Shame, murder, fame, and wrong.--
  Celso!

                           _Enter_ CELSO.

  _Celso._ My honour'd lord?

  _Men._ The good Malevole, that plain-tongu'd man,
  Alas, is dead on sudden, wondrous strangely!
  He held in our esteem good place. Celso,
  See him buried, see him buried.

  _Celso._ I shall observe ye.

  _Men._ And, Celso, prithee, let it be thy care to-night
  To have some pretty show, to solemnise
  Our high instalment; some music, maskery.                       250
  We'll give fair entertain unto Maria,
  The duchess to the banish'd Altofront:
  Thou shalt conduct her from the citadel
  Unto the palace. Think on some maskery.

  _Celso._ Of what shape, sweet lord?

  _Men._ What[552] shape! why, any quick-done fiction;
  As some brave spirits of the Genoan dukes,
  To come out of Elysium, forsooth,
  Led in by Mercury, to gratulate
  Our happy fortune; some such anything,                          260
  Some far-fet[553] trick good for ladies, some stale toy
  Or other, no matter, so't be of our devising.
  Do thou prepare't; 'tis but for fashion[554] sake;
  Fear not, it shall be grac'd, man, it shall take.

  _Celso._ All service.

  _Men._ All thanks; our hand shall not be close to thee: farewell.
  [_Aside._] Now is my treachery secure, nor can we fall:
  Mischief that prospers, men do virtue call.
  I'll trust no man: he that by tricks gets wreaths
  Keeps them with steel; no man securely breathes                 270
  Out of deserv�d[555] ranks; the crowd will mutter, "fool:"
  Who cannot bear with spite, he cannot rule.
  The chiefest secret for a man of state
  Is, to live senseless of a strengthless hate.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Mal._ [_starting up_] Death of the damned thief! I'll
  make one i' the mask; thou shalt ha' some brave spirits
  of the antique dukes.

  _Cel._ My lord, what strange delusion?

  _Mal._ Most happy, dear Celso, poisoned with an empty
  box: I'll give thee all, anon: my lady comes to court;
  there is a whirl of fate comes tumbling on; the castle's
  captain stands for me, the people pray for me, and the
  great leader of the just stands for me: then courage,
  Celso;                                                          284
  For no disastrous chance can ever move him
  That leaveth nothing but a God above him.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

     [549] Some copies of ed. 2. "c�modites."--The compositor was
     thinking of the common expression _take up commodities_.

     [550] Ed. 2. "power."

     [551] Ed. 2. "or."

     [552] Old eds. "Why."

                             SCENE III.

                      _The Presence-Chamber._

     _Enter_ BILIOSO _and_ PREPASSO, _two_ Pages _before them_;
                 MAQUERELLE, BIANCA, _and_ EMILIA.

  _Bil._ Make room there, room for the ladies! why,
  gentlemen, will not ye suffer the ladies to be entered in
  the great chamber? why, gallants! and you, sir, to drop
  your torch where the beauties must sit too!

  _Pre._ And there's a great fellow plays the knave; why
  dost not strike him?

  _Bil._ Let him play the knave, o' God's name; thinkest
  thou I have no more wit than to strike a great fellow?--The
  music! more lights! revelling-scaffolds! do you
  hear? Let there be oaths enow ready at the door,
  swear out the devil himself. Let's leave the ladies, and
  go see if the lords be ready for them.                           12

                            [_Exeunt_ BILIOSO, PREPASSO, _and_ Pages.

  _Maq._ And, by my troth, beauties, why do you not put
  you into the fashion? this is a stale cut; you must come
  in fashion: look ye, you must be all felt, felt and feather,
  a felt upon your bare hair:[556] look ye, these tiring things
  are justly out of request now: and, do ye hear? you
  must wear falling-bands, you must come into the falling
  fashion: there is such a deal o' pinning these ruffs, when
  the fine clean fall is worth all: and again, if ye should
  chance to take a nap in the afternoon, your falling-band
  requires no poting-stick[557] to recover his form: believe
  me, no fashion to the falling,[558] I say.                       23

  _Bian._ And is not Signior St. Andrew[559] a gallant fellow
  now.

  _Maq._ By my maidenhead, la, honour and he agree as
  well together as a satin suit and woollen stockings.

  _Emilia._ But is not Marshal Make-room, my servant
  in reversion, a proper gentleman?                                29

  _Maq._ Yes, in reversion, as he had his office; as, in
  truth, he hath all things in reversion: he has his mistress
  in reversion, his clothes in reversion, his wit in reversion;
  and, indeed, is a suitor to me for my dog in
  reversion: but, in good verity, la, he is as proper a
  gentleman in reversion as--and, indeed, as fine a man
  as may be, having a red beard and a pair of warpt[560] legs.

  _Bian._ But, i'faith, I am most monstrously in love with
  Count Quidlibet-in-quodlibet: is he not a pretty, dapper,
  unidle[561] gallant?                                             39

  _Maq._ He is even one of the most busy-fingered lords;
  he will put the beauties to the squeak most hideously.

                        _Re-enter_ BILIOSO.

  _Bil._ Room! make a lane there! the duke is entering:
  stand handsomely for beauty's sake, take up the ladies
  there! So, cornets, cornets!

  _Re-enter_ PREPASSO, _joins to_ BILIOSO; _then enter two_
  Pages _with lights_, FERRARDO, MENDOZA; _at the other door, two_
  Pages _with lights, and the Captain leading in_ MARIA; MENDOZA
  _meets_ MARIA _and closeth with her; the rest fall back_.

  _Men._ Madam, with gentle ear receive my suit;
  A kingdom's safety should o'er-peise[562] slight rites;
  Marriage is merely nature's policy:
  Then, since unless our royal beds be join'd,
  Danger and civil tumults fright the state,
  Be wise as you are fair, give way to fate.                       50

  _Maria._ What wouldst thou, thou affliction to our house?
  Thou ever-devil, 'twas thou that banished'st
  My truly noble lord!

  _Men._ I!

  _Maria._ Ay, by thy plots, by thy black stratagems:
  Twelve moons have suffer'd change since I beheld
  The lov�d presence of my dearest lord.
  O thou far worse than death! he parts but soul
  From a weak body; but thou soul from soul
  Dissever'st, that which God's own hand did knit;                 60
  Thou scant of honour, full of devilish wit!

  _Men._ We'll check your too-intemperate lavishness:
  I can, and will.

  _Maria._ What canst?

  _Men._ Go to; in banishment thy husband dies.

  _Maria._ He ever is at home that's ever wise.

  _Men._ You'st[563] ne'er meet more: reason should love control.

  _Maria._ Not meet!
  She that dear loves, her love's still in her soul.

  _Men._ You are but a woman, lady, you must yield.                70

  _Maria._ O, save me, thou innated bashfulness,
  Thou only ornament of woman's modesty!

  _Men._ Modesty! death, I'll torment thee.

  _Maria._ Do, urge all torments, all afflictions try;
  I'll die my lord's as long as I can die.

  _Men._ Thou obstinate, thou shalt die.--Captain, that lady's life
  Is forfeited to justice: we have examin'd her,
  And we do find she hath empoison�d
  The reverend hermit; therefore we command
  Severest custody.--Nay, if you'll do's no good,                  80
  You'st do's no harm: a tyrant's peace is blood.

  _Maria._ O, thou art merciful; O gracious devil,
  Rather by much let me condemn�d be
  For seeming murder than be damn'd for thee!
  I'll mourn no more; come, girt my brows with flowers:
  Revel and dance, soul, now thy wish thou hast;
  Die like a bride, poor heart, thou shalt die chaste.

                _Enter_ AURELIA _in mourning habit_.

  Life[564] is a frost of cold felicity,--

  _Aur._ And death the thaw of all our vanity:
  Was't not an honest priest that wrote so?                        90

  _Men._ Who let her in?

  _Bil._ Forbear!

  _Pre._ Forbear!

  _Aur._ Alas, calamity is everywhere:
  Sad misery, despite your double doors,
  Will enter even in court.

  _Bil._ Peace!

  _Aur._I ha' done.[565]

  _Bil._ One word,--take heed!

  _Aur._ I ha' done.

                 _Enter_ MERCURY _with loud music_.

  _Mer._ Cyllenian Mercury, the god of ghosts,
  From gloomy shades that spread the lower coasts,[566]
  Calls four high-fam�d Genoan[567] dukes to come,                100
  And make this presence their Elysium,
  To pass away this high triumphal night
  With song and dances, court's more soft delight.

  _Aur._ Are you god of ghosts? I have a suit pending
  in hell betwixt me and my conscience; I would fain have
  thee help me to an advocate.

  _Bil._ Mercury shall be your lawyer, lady.

  _Aur._ Nay, faith, Mercury has too good a face to be a
  right lawyer.

  _Pre._ Peace, forbear! Mercury presents the mask.               110

  _Cornets: the song to the cornets, which playing, the mask enters_;
     MALEVOLE, PIETRO, FERNEZE, _and_ CELSO, _in white robes, with
     dukes' crowns upon laurel-wreaths, pistolets and short swords
     under their robes_.

  _Men._ Celso, Celso, court[568] Maria for our love.--
  Lady, be gracious, yet grace.

  _Maria._ With me, sir?

                                  [MALEVOLE _takes_ MARIA _to dance_.

  _Mal._ Yes, more lov�d than my breath;
  With you I'll dance.

  _Maria._ Why, then, you dance with death.
  But, come, sir, I was ne'er more apt for[569] mirth.
  Death gives eternity a glorious breath:
  O, to die honour'd, who would fear to die?

  _Mal._ They die in fear who live in villainy.

  _Men._ Yes, believe him, lady, and be rul'd by him.

  _Pietro._ Madam, with me.

                                  [PIETRO _takes_ AURELIA _to dance_.

  _Aur._ Wouldst, then, be miserable?                             120

  _Pietro._ I need not wish.

  _Aur._ O, yet forbear my hand! away! fly! fly!
  O, seek not her that only seeks to die!

  _Pietro._ Poor lov�d soul!

  _Aur._ What, wouldst court misery?

  _Pietro._ Yes.

  _Aur._ She'll come too soon:--O my griev�d heart!

  _Pietro._ Lady, ha' done, ha' done:
  Come,[570] let us dance; be once from sorrow free.

  _Aur._ Art a sad man?

  _Pietro._ Yes, sweet.

  _Aur._ Then we'll agree.                                        128

                      [FERNEZE _takes_ MAQUERELLE _and_ CELSO BIANCA:
                         _then the cornets sound the measure, one
                         change, and rest_.

  _Fer._ [_to_ BIANCA.] Believe it, lady; shall I swear? let
  me enjoy you in private, and I'll marry you, by my soul.

  _Bian._ I had rather you would swear by your body:
  I think that would prove the more regarded oath with
  you.

  _Fer._ I'll swear by them both, to please you.

  _Bian._ O, damn them not both to please me, for God's
  sake!                                                           136

  _Fer._ Faith, sweet creature, let me enjoy you to-night,
  and I'll marry you to-morrow fortnight, by my troth, la.

  _Maq._ On his troth, la! believe him not; that kind of
  cony-catching is as stale as Sir Oliver Anchovy's perfumed[571]
  jerkin: promise of matrimony by a young gallant,
  to bring a virgin lady into a fool's paradise; make her a
  great woman, and then cast her off;--'tis as common
  and[572] natural to a courtier, as jealousy to a citizen,
  gluttony to a puritan, wisdom to an alderman, pride to
  a tailor, or an empty hand-basket[573] to one of these sixpenny
  damnations: of his troth, la! believe him not;
  traps to catch pole-cats.

  _Mal._ [_to_ MARIA]. Keep your face constant, let no sudden passion
  Speak in your eyes.

  _Maria._ O my Altofront!                                        150

  _Pietro._ [_to_ AURELIA.] A tyrant's jealousies
  Are very nimble: you receive it all?

  _Aur._ My heart, though not my knees, doth humbly fall
  Low as the earth, to thee.

  _Mal._[574] Peace! next change; no words.

  _Maria._ Speech to such, ay, O, what will affords!

                        [_Cornets sound the measure over again; which
                             danced, they unmask._

  _Men._ Malevole!

             [_They environ_ MENDOZA, _bending their pistols on him_.

  _Mal._ No.

  _Men._ Altofront! Duke Pietro![575] Ferneze! ha!

  _All._ Duke Altofront! Duke Altofront!

                  [_Cornets, a flourish._--_They seize upon_ MENDOZA.

  _Men._ Are we surpris'd? what strange delusions mock            160
  Our senses? do I dream? or have I dreamt
  This two days' space? where am I?

  _Mal._ Where an arch-villain is.

  _Men._ O, lend me breath till[576] I am fit to die!
  For peace with heaven, for your own souls' sake,
  Vouchsafe me life!

  _Pietro._ Ignoble villain! whom neither heaven nor hell,
  Goodness of God or man, could once make good!

  _Mal._ Base, treacherous wretch! what grace canst thou expect,
  That hast grown impudent in gracelessness?                      170

  _Men._ O, life!

  _Mal._ Slave, take thy life.
  Wert thou defenc�d, th[o]rough blood and wounds,
  The sternest horror of a civil fight,
  Would I achieve thee; but prostrate at my feet,
  I scorn to hurt thee: 'tis the heart of slaves
  That deigns to triumph over peasants' graves;
  For such thou art, since birth doth ne'er enroll
  A man 'mong monarchs, but a glorious soul.
  O,[577] I have seen strange accidents of state!                 180
  The flatterer, like the ivy, clip the oak,
  And waste it to the heart; lust so confirm'd,
  That the black act of sin itself not sham'd
  To be term'd courtship.
  O, they that are as great as be their sins,
  Let them remember that th' inconstant people
  Love many princes[578] merely for their faces
  And outward shows; and they do covet more
  To have a sight of these than of their virtues.
  Yet thus much let the great ones still conceive,[579]           190
  When they observe not heaven's impos'd conditions,
  They are no kings,[580] but forfeit their commissions.

  _Maq._ O good my lord, I have lived in the court this
  twenty year: they that have been old courtiers, and
  come to live in the city, they are spited at, and thrust
  to the walls like apricocks, good my lord.

  _Bil._ My lord, I did know your lordship in this disguise;
  you heard me ever say, if Altofront did return, I
  would stand for him: besides, 'twas your lordship's
  pleasure to call me wittol and cuckold: you must not
  think, but that I knew you, I would have put it up so
  patiently.                                                      202

  _Mal._ You o'er-joy'd spirits, wipe your long-wet eyes.

                                          [_To_ PIETRO _and_ AURELIA.

  Hence with this man [_Kicks out_ MENDOZA]: an eagle takes
     not flies.
  You to your vows [_To_ PIETRO _and_ AURELIA]: and thou
     into the suburbs.[581]                         [_To_ MAQUERELLE.
  You to my worst friend I would hardly give;
  Thou art a perfect old knave [_To_ BILIOSO]: all-pleas'd live
  You two unto my breast [_To_ CELSO and the Captain]:
     thou to my heart.                                   [_To_ MARIA.
  The rest of idle actors idly part:
  And as for me, I here assume my right,                          210
  To which I hope all's pleas'd: to all, good-night.

                                      [_Cornets, a flourish. Exeunt._

            AN[582] IMPERFECT ODE, BEING BUT ONE STAFF,

                      SPOKEN BY THE PROLOGUE.


  To wrest each hurtless thought to private sense
  Is the foul use of ill-bred impudence:
          Immodest censure now grows wild,
                  All over-running.
          Let innocence be ne'er so chaste,
                Yet at the last
                She is defil'd
          With too nice-brain�d cunning.
                O you of fairer soul,
                    Control          10
                With an Herculean arm
                    This harm;
  And once teach all old freedom of a pen,
  Which still must write of fools, whiles't writes of men!


     [582] The "imperfect ode" and the epilogue are not found in some
     copies of ed. 1.




                             EPILOGUS.


  Your modest silence, full of heedy stillness,
  Makes me thus speak: a voluntary illness
  Is merely[583] senseless; but unwilling error,
  Such as proceeds from too rash youthful fervour,
  May well be call'd a fault, but not a sin:
  Rivers take names from founts where they begin.
  Then let not too severe an eye peruse
  The slighter brakes[584] of our reform�d Muse,
  Who could herself herself of faults detect,
  But that she knows 'tis easy to correct,                         10
  Though some men's labour: troth, to err is fit,
  As long as wisdom's not profess'd, but wit.
  Then till another's happier Muse appears,[585]
  Till his Thalia feast your learn�d ears,
  To whose desertful lamps pleased Fates impart
  Art above nature, judgment above art,
  Receive this piece, which hope nor fear yet daunteth:
  He that knows most knows most how much he wanteth.

                               ACT I.


                              SCENE I.

                            _A Street._

       _Enter three Pages, with lights._ MULLIGRUB, FREEVILL,
               MALHEUREUX, TYSEFEW, _and_ CAQUETEUR.


  _Free._ Nay, comfort, my good host Shark; my good
  Mulligrub.

  _Mal._ Advance thy snout; do not suffer thy sorrowful
  nose to drop on thy Spanish[2] leather jerkin, most
  hardly-honest Mulligrub.

  _Free._ What, cogging Cocledemoy is run away with
  a neast[3] of goblets? True, what then? they will be
  hammered out well enough, I warrant you.

  _Mul._ Sure, some wise man would find them out
  presently.                                                       10

  _Free._ Yes, sure, if we could find out some wise man
  presently.

  _Mal._ How was the plate lost? how did it vanish?

  _Free._ In most sincere prose, thus: that man of much
  money, some wit, but less honesty, cogging Cocledemoy,
  comes this night late into mine hostess Mulligrub's
  tavern here; calls for a room; the house being full,
  Cocledemoy consorted with his movable chattel, his
  instrument of fornication, the bawd Mrs. Mary Faugh,
  are imparlour'd next the street; good poultry was their
  food, blackbird, lark, woodcock; and mine host here
  comes in, cries "God bless you!" and departs. A
  blind harper enters, craves audience, uncaseth, plays;
  the drawer, for female privateness' sake, is nodded out,
  who knowing that whosoever will hit the mark of profit
  must, like those that shoot in stone-bows,[4] wink with
  one eye, grows blind o' the right side, and departs.             27

  _Caq._ He shall answer for that winking with one eye
  at the last day.

  _Mal._ Let him have day[5] till then, and he will wink
  with both his eyes.

  _Free._ Cocledemoy, perceiving none in the room but
  the blind harper (whose eyes Heaven had shut up from
  beholding wickedness), unclasps a casement to the
  street very patiently, pockets up three bowls unnaturally,
  thrusts his wench forth the window, and himself
  most preposterously, with his heels forward, follows:
  the unseeing harper plays on, bids the empty dishes and
  the treacherous candles much good do them. The
  drawer returns, but, out alas! not only the birds, but
  also the neast of goblets, were flown away. Laments
  are raised----                                                   42

  _Tys._ Which did not pierce the heavens.

  _Free._ The drawers moan, mine host doth cry, the
  bowls are gone.

  _Mul._ _Hic finis Priami!_

  _Mal._ Nay, be not jaw-fall'n, my most sharking Mulligrub.

  _Free._ 'Tis your just affliction; remember the sins of
  the cellar, and repent, repent!                                  50

  _Mul._ I am not jaw-fall'n, but I will hang the coney-catching
  Cocledemoy; and there's an end of't.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Caq._ Is it a right stone? it shows well by candle-light.

  _Free._ So do many things that are counterfeit, but I
  assure you this is a right diamond.

  _Caq._ Might I borrow it of you? it will not a little
  grace my finger in visitation of my mistress.

  _Free._ Why, use it, most sweet Caqueteur, use it.

  _Caq._ Thanks, good sir; 'tis grown high night:
  gentles, rest to you.
                                                             [_Exit._

  _Tys._ A torch! Sound wench, soft sleep, and sanguine
  dreams to you both. On, boy!                                     62

  _Free._ Let me bid you good rest.

  _Mal._ Not so, trust me, I must bring my friend home:
  I dare not give you up to your own company; I fear
  the warmth of wine and youth will draw you to some
  common house of lascivious entertainment.

  _Free._ Most necessary buildings, Malheureux; ever
  since my intention of marriage, I do pray for their
  continuance.                                                     70

  _Mal._ Loved sir, your reason?

  _Free._ Marry, lest my house should be made one. I
  would have married men love the stews as Englishmen
  loved the Low Countries: wish war should be maintain'd
  there, lest it should come home to their own doors.
  What, [not] suffer a man to have a hole to put his head
  in, though he go to the pillory for it! Youth and appetite
  are above the club of Hercules.

  _Mal._ This lust is a most deadly sin, sure.

  _Free._ Nay, 'tis a most lively sin, sure.                       80

  _Mal._ Well, I am sure, 'tis one of the head sins.

  _Free._ Nay, I am sure it is one of the middle sins.

  _Mal._ Pity 'tis grown a most daily vice.

  _Free._ But a more nightly vice, I assure you.

  _Mal._ Well, 'tis a sin.

  _Free._ Ay, or else few men would wish to go to heaven:
  and, not to disguise with my friend, I am now going the
  way of all flesh.

  _Mal._ Not to a courtezan?

  _Free._ A courteous one.                                         90

  _Mal._ What, to a sinner?

  _Free._ A very publican.

  _Mal._ Dear, my loved friend, let me be full with you:
  Know, sir, the strongest argument that speaks
  Against the soul's eternity is lust,
  That wise man's folly, and the fool's wisdom:
  But to grow wild in loose lasciviousness,
  Given up to heat and sensual appetite,
  Nay, to expose your health and strength and name,
  Your precious time, and with that time the hope                 100
  Of due preferment, advantageous means,
  Of any worthy end, to the stale use,
  The common bosom of a money creature,
  One that sells human flesh--a mangonist!

  _Free._ Alas, good creatures! what would you have
  them do? Would you have them get their living by
  the curse of man, the sweat of their brows? So they do:
  every man must follow his trade, and every woman her
  occupation. A poor decayed mechanical man's wife,
  her husband is laid up, may not she lawfully be laid
  down, when her husband's only rising is by his wife's
  falling? A captain's wife wants means; her commander
  lies in open fields abroad, may not she lie in civil arms
  at home? A waiting gentlewoman, that had wont to
  take say[6] to her lady, miscarries or so; the court
  misfortune throws her down; may not the city courtesy
  take her up? Do you know no alderman would pity
  such a woman's case?[7] Why, is charity grown a sin,
  or relieving the poor and impotent an offence? You
  will say beasts take no money for their fleshly entertainment:
  true, because they are beasts, therefore beastly;[8]
  only men give to loose, because they are men, therefore
  manly: and indeed, wherein should they bestow their
  money better? In land, the title may be crack'd; in
  houses, they may be burnt; in apparel, 'twill wear; in
  wine, alas for our pity! our throat is but short: but
  employ your[9] money upon women, and a thousand to
  nothing, some one of them will bestow that on you
  which shall stick by you as long as you live; they are
  no ungrateful persons, they will give quid [10] for quo: do
  ye protest, they'll swear; do you rise, they'll fall; do
  you fall, they'll rise; do you give them the French
  crown, they'll give you the French--_O justus justa
  justum!_ They sell their bodies: do not better persons
  sell their souls? nay, since all things have been sold,
  honour, justice, faith, nay, even God Himself,                  136
  Aye me, what base ignobleness is it
  To sell the pleasure of a wanton bed!
  Why do men scrape, why heap to full heaps join?
  But for his mistress, who would care for coin?
  For this I hold to be denied of no man,
  All things are made for man, and man for woman.
  Give me my fee.

  _Mal._ Of ill you merit well. My heart's good friend,
  Leave yet at length, at length; for know this ever,
  'Tis no such sin to err, but to persever.

  _Free._ Beauty is woman's virtue, love the life's music,
  and woman the dainties, or second course of heaven's
  curious workmanship. Since then beauty, love, and
  woman are good, how can the love of woman's beauty
  be bad? and, _Bonum, quo communius, eo melius_: wilt
  then go with me?                                                152

  _Mal._ Whither?

  _Free._ To a house of salvation.

  _Mal._ Salvation?

  _Free._ Yes, 'twill make thee repent. Wilt go to the
  family of love?[11] I will show thee my creature; a pretty
  nimble-ey'd Dutch tanakin;[12] an honest soft-hearted
  impropriation; a soft, plump, round-cheek'd froe,[13] that
  has beauty enough for her virtue, virtue enough for a
  woman, and woman enough for any reasonable man in
  my knowledge. Wilt pass along with me?                          162

  _Mal._ What, to a brothel?--to behold an impudent
  prostitution;[14] fie on't, I shall hate the whole sex to see
  her. The most odious spectacle the earth can present
  is an immodest vulgar woman.

  _Free._ Good still; my brain shall keep't. You must
  go as you love me.

  _Mal._ Well, I'll go to make her loath the shame she's in;
  The sight of vice augments the hate of sin.                     170

  _Free._ The sight of vice augments the hate of sin!
  Very fine, perdy!

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                             SCENE II.

                            _A Brothel._

                _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY _and_ MARY FAUGH.


  _Coc._ Mary, Mary Faugh.

  _Mar._ Hem.[15]

  _Coc._ Come, my worshipful rotten rough-bellied bawd!
  ha! my blue-tooth'd patroness of natural wickedness,
  give me the goblets.

  _Mar._ By yea and by nay, Master Cocledemoy, I fear
  you'll play the knave, and restore them.

  _Coc._ No, by the lord, aunt,[16] restitution is catholic,
  and thou know'st we love----

  _Mar._ What?                                                     10

  _Coc._ Oracles are ceased: _tempus pr�teritum_, doest hear,
  my worshipful glysterpipe, thou ungodly fire that burnt
  Diana's temple?--doest hear, bawd?

  _Mar._ In very good truthness, you are the foulest-mouth'd,
  profane, railing brother, call a woman the most
  ungodly names: I must confess, we all eat of the forbidden
  fruit, and for mine own part, though I am one of
  the family of love, and, as they say, a bawd that covers
  the multitude of sins, yet I trust I am none of the wicked
  that eat fish o' Fridays.                                        20

  _Coc._ Hang toasts! I rail at thee, my worshipful organ-bellows
  that fills the pipes, my fine rattling fleamy cough
  o' the lungs, and cold with a pox? I rail at thee? what,
  my right precious pandress, supportress of barber-surgeons,
  and enhanceress[17] of lotium[18] and diet-drink?[19]
  I rail at thee, necessary damnation? I'll make an
  oration, I, in praise of thy most courtly in-fashion and
  most pleasureable function, I.

  _Mar._ Ay, prithee do, I love to hear myself praised, as
  well as any old lady, I.                                         30

  _Coc._ List then:--a bawd; first for her profession or
  vocation, it is most worshipful of all the twelve companies;
  for, as that trade is most honourable that sells
  the best commodities--as the draper is more worshipful
  than the pointmaker, the silkman more worshipful than
  the draper, and the goldsmith more honourable than
  both, little Mary, so the bawd above all: her shop has
  the best ware; for where these sell but cloth, satins, and
  jewels, she sells divine virtues, as virginity, modesty, and
  such rare gems; and those not like a petty chapman, by
  retail, but like a great merchant, by wholesale; wa, ha,
  ho! And who are her customers? Not base corn-cutters
  or sowgelders, but most rare wealthy knights,
  and most rare bountiful lords, are her customers. Again,
  whereas no trade or vocation profiteth but by the loss
  and displeasure of another--as the merchant thrives not
  but by the licentiousness of giddy[20] and unsettled youth;
  the lawyer, but by the vexation of his client; the physician,
  but by the maladies of his patient--only my
  smooth-gumm'd bawd lives by others' pleasure, and
  only grows rich by others' rising. O merciful gain, O
  righteous in-come! So much for her vocation, trade,
  and life. As for their death, how can it be bad, since
  their wickedness is always before their eyes, and a
  death's[21] head most commonly on their middle-finger?
  To conclude, 'tis most certain they must needs both live
  well and die well, since most commonly they live in
  Clerkenwell,[22] and die in Bride-well. _Dixi, Mary._           158

                 _Enter_ FREEVILL _and_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ Come along, yonder's the preface or exordium
  to my wench, the bawd. Fetch, fetch! What! Mr.
  Cocledemoy, is your knaveship yet stirring? Look to it,
  Mulligrub lies[23] for you.

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ The more fool he; I can lie for myself, worshipful
  friend. Hang toasts! I vanish. Ha! my fine boy,
  thou art a scholar, and hast read Tully's _Offices_, my fine
  knave. Hang toasts!

  _Free._ The vintner will toast you, and he catch you.

  _Coc._ I will draw the vintner to the stoop, and when
  he runs low, tilt him. Ha! my fine knave, art going to
  thy recreation?                                                 170

  _Free._ Yes, my capricious rascal.

  _Coc._ Thou wilt look like a fool then, by and by.

  _Free._ Look like a fool, why?

  _Coc._ Why, according to the old saying: a beggar
  when he is lousing of himself, looks like a philosopher;
  a hard-bound philosopher, when he is on the stool, looks
  like a tyrant; and a wise man, when he is in his belly
  act, looks like a fool. God give your worship good rest!
  grace and mercy keep your syringe straight, and your
  lotium unspilt.                                                 180

                       _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Free._ See, sir, this is she.

  _Mal._ This?

  _Free._ This.

  _Mal._ A courtezan?--Now, cold blood defend me!
  What a propension[24] afflicts me!

  _Fran._ O, mine aderliver[25] love, vat sall me do to requit
  dis your mush affection?

  _Free._ Marry, salute my friend, clip his neck, and kiss
  him welcome.

  _Fran._ A' mine art, sir, you bin very velcome.                 190

  _Free._ Kiss her, man, with a more familiar affection, so.
  Come, what entertainment? go to your lute.

                                              [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA.

  And how dost approve my sometimes elected? She's
  none of your ramping cannibals that devour man's flesh,
  nor any of your Curtian gulfs that will never be satisfied
  until the best thing a man has be thrown into them.
  I loved her with my heart, until my soul showed me the
  imperfection of my body, and placed my affection on a
  lawful love, my modest Beatrice, which if this shortheels
  knew, there were no being for me with eyes before her
  face. But, faith, dost thou not somewhat excuse my
  sometimes incontinency, with her enforcive beauties?
  Speak.                                                          203

  _Mal._ Hah! she is a whore, is she not?

  _Free._ Whore? fie, whore! you may call her a courtezan,
  a cockatrice,[26] or (as that worthy spirit of an eternal happiness
  said) a suppository. But whore! fie, 'tis not in
  fashion to call things by their right names. Is a great
  merchant a cuckold, you must say he is one of the
  livery. Is a great lord a fool, you must say he is weak.
  Is a gallant pocky, you must say he has the court scab.
  Come, she's your mistress or so.                                212

               _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA, _with her lute_.

  Come, siren, your voice.

  _Fra._ Vill not you stay in mine bosom to-night, love?

  _Free._ By no means, sweet breast; this gentleman has
  vow'd to see me chastely laid.

  _Fra._ He shall have a bed too, if dat it please him.

  _Free._ Peace, you tender him offence; he is one of a
  professed abstinence. Siren, your voice and away.

                      _She sings to her Lute._

                             THE SONG.

                    _The dark is my delight,                      220
                       So 'tis the nightingale's;
                     My music's in the night,
                       So is the nightingale's;
                     My body is but little,
                       So is the nightingale's;
                     I love to sleep 'gainst prickle,
                       So doth the nightingale._

  Thanks; buss; so. The night grows old; good rest.

  _Fra._ Rest to mine dear love; rest, and no long absence.       230

  _Free._ Believe me, not long.

  _Fra._ Sall ick not believe you long?

                                                [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Free._ O yes, come, _via!_[27]--away, boy--on!

                                      [_Exit, his Page lighting him._

      _Re-enter_ FREEVILL, _and seems to overhear_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Mal._ Is she unchaste--can such a one be damn'd?
  O love and beauty! ye two eldest seeds
  Of the vast chaos, what strong right you have
  Even in things divine--our very souls!

  _Free._ [_aside._] Wha, ha, ho! come, bird, come. Stand, peace!

  _Mal._ Are strumpets then such things so delicate?
  Can custom spoil what nature made so good?                      240
  Or is their custom bad? Beauty's for use--
  I never saw a sweet face vicious!
  It might be proud, inconstant, wanton, nice,
  But never tainted with unnatural vice.
  Their worst is, their best art is love to win--
  O that to love should be or shame, or sin!

  _Free._ [_aside._] By the Lord! he's caught! Laughter eternal!

  _Mal._ Soul, I must love her! Destiny is weak
  To my affection.--A common love!--
  Blush not, faint breast!                                        250
  That which is ever loved of most is best.
  Let colder eld the strong'st objections move,
  No love's without some lust, no life without some love.

  _Free._ Nay, come on, good sir; what, though the most
  odious spectacle the world can present be an immodest
  vulgar woman? yet, sir, for my sake----

  _Mal._ Well, sir, for your sake, I'll think better of them.

  _Free._ Do, good sir; and pardon me that have brought you in:
  You know the sight of vice augments the hate of sin.

  _Mal._ Hah! will you go home, sir; 'tis high bedtime?           260

  _Free._ With all my heart, sir; only do not chide me.
  I must confess----

  _Mal._ A wanton lover you have been.

  _Free._ O that to love should be or shame or sin!

  _Mal._ Say ye?

  _Free._ Let colder eld the strongest objections move!

  _Mal._ How's this?

  _Free._ No love's without some lust, no life without some love.
  Go your ways for an apostata! I believe my cast garment
  must be let out in the seams for you when all is
  done.                                                           270
  Of all the fools that would all man out-thrust,
  He that 'gainst Nature would seem wise is worst.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                              ACT II.


                              SCENE I.

      _Outside_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOY'S _house, under_ BEATRICE'S
                             _window_.

      _Enter_ FREEVILL, _Pages with torches and Gentlemen with
                              music_.


  _Free._ The morn is yet but young. Here, gentlemen,
  This is my Beatrice' window--this the chamber
  Of my betroth�d dearest, whose chaste eyes,
  Full of loved sweetness and clear cheerfulness,
  Have gaged my soul to her enjoyings;
  Shredding away all those weak under-branches
  Of base affections and unfruitful heats.
  Here bestow your music to my voice.

                                                           [_A song._

                     _Enter_ BEATRICE _above_.

  Always a virtuous name to my chaste love!

  _Bea._ Loved sir,                                                10
  The honour of your wish return to you.
  I cannot with a mistress' compliment,
  Forc�d discourses, or nice art of wit,
  Give entertain to your dear-wish�d presence:
  But safely thus,--what hearty gratefulness,
  Unsullen silence, unaffected modesty,
  And an unignorant shamefastness can express,
  Receive as your protested due. 'Faith, my heart,
  I am your servant.
  O let not my secure simplicity                                   20
  Breed your mislike, as one quite void of skill;
  'Tis grace enough in us not to be ill.
  I can some good, and, faith, I mean no hurt;
  Do not then, sweet, wrong sober ignorance.
  I judge you all of virtue, and our vows
  Should kill all fears that base distrust can move.
  My soul, what say you--still you love?

  _Free._ Still!
  My vow is up above me, and, like time,
  Irrevocable: I am sworn all yours.
  No beauty shall untwine our arms, no face                        30
  In my eyes can or shall seem fair;
  And would to God only to me you might
  Seem only fair! Let others disesteem
  Your matchless graces, so might I safer seem;
  Envy I covet not. Far, far be all ostent--
  Vain boasts of beauties, soft joys, and the rest:
  He that is wise pants on a private breast.
  So could I live in desert most unknown,
  Yourself to me enough were populous;[28]
  Your eyes shall be my joys, my wine that still                   40
  Shall drown my often cares; your only voice
  Shall cast a slumber on my list'ning sense;
  You, with soft lip, shall only ope mine eyes
  And suck their lids asunder; only you
  Shall make me wish to live, and not fear death,
  So on your cheeks I might yield latest breath.
  O he that thus may live and thus shall die,
  May well be envied of a deity.[29]

  _Bea._ Dear, my loved heart, be not so passionate;
  Nothing extreme lives long.                                      50

  _Free._ But not to be extreme[30]--nothing in love's extreme--
  My love receives no mean.

  _Bea._ I give you faith; and, prithee, since, poor soul!
  I am so easy to believe thee, make it much more pity to
  deceive me!
  Wear this slight favour in my remembrance.

                                      [_Throweth down a ring to him._

  _Free._ Which, when I part from,
  Hope, the best of life, ever part from me.

  _Bea._ I take you and your word, which may ever live
  your servant. See, day is quite broke up--the best of
  hours.                                                           61

  _Free._ Good morrow, graceful mistress: our nuptial
  day holds.

  _Bea._ With happy constancy a wish�d day.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Free._ Myself and all content rest with you.

                        _Enter_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Mal._ The studious morn, with paler cheek, draws on
  The day's bold light. Hark how the free-born birds
  Carol their unaffected passions!

                                           [_The nightingales sing._

  Now sing they sonnets--thus they cry, We love!
  O breath of heaven! thus they, harmless souls,                   70
  Give entertain to mutual affects.
  They have no bawds, no mercenary beds,
  No polite restraints, no artificial heats,
  No faint dissemblings; no custom makes them blush,
  No shame afflicts their name. O you happy beasts!
  In whom an inborn heat is not held sin,
  How far transcend you wretched, wretched man,
  Whom national custom, tyrannous respects
  Of slavish order, fetters, lames his power,
  Calling that sin in us which in all things else                  80
  Is Nature's highest virtue.
  _O miseri quorum gaudia crimen habent!_
  Sure Nature against virtue cross doth fall,
  Or virtue's self is oft unnatural.
  That I should love a strumpet! I, a man of snow!
  Now, shame forsake me--whither am I fallen!
  A creature of a public use! my friend's love, too!
  To live to be a talk to men--a shame
  To my professed virtue! O accursed reason,
  How many eyes hast thou to see thy shame,                        90
  And yet how blind once to prevent defame!

  _Free._ _Diaboli virtus in lumbis est!_ Morrow, my
  friend. Come, I could make a tedious scene of this
  now; but what----Pah! thou art in love with a
  courtezan! Why, sir, should we loathe all strumpets,
  some men should hate their own mothers or sisters: a
  sin against kind, I can tell you.

  _Mal._ May it beseem a wise man to be in love?

  _Free._ Let wise men alone, 'twill beseem thee and me
  well enough.                                                    100

  _Mal._ Shall I not offend the vowe[d] band of our
  friendship?

  _Free._ What, to affect that which thy friend affected?
  By Heaven, I resign her freely; the creature and I
  must grow off; by this time she has assure[d]ly heard of
  my resolved marriage, and no question swears "God's
  sacrament, ten towsand divells." I'll resign, i'faith.

  _Mal._ I would but embrace her, hear her speak, and
  at the most, but kiss her.

  _Free._ O friend, he that could live with the smoke of
  roast-meat might live at a cheap rate!                          111

  _Mal._ I shall ne'er prove heartily received;
  A kind of flat ungracious modesty,
  An insufficient dulness stains my 'haviour.

  _Free._ No matter, sir; insufficiency and sottishness
  are much commendable in a most discommendable
  action: now could I swallow thee, thou hadst wont to
  be so harsh and cold: I'll tell thee,--hell and the prodigies
  of angry Jove are not so fearful to a thinking mind
  as a man without affection. Why, friend, philosophy
  and nature are all one; love is the centre in which all
  lines close, the common bond of being.                          122

  _Mal._ O but a chaste reserv�d privateness,
  A modest continence!

  _Free._ I'll tell thee what, take this as firmest sense:--
  Incontinence will force a continence;
  Heat wasteth heat, light defaceth light,
  Nothing is spoiled but by his proper might.
  This is something too weighty for thy floor.

  _Mal._ But howsoe'er you shade it, the world's eye              130
  Shines hot and open on't;
  Lying, malice, envy, are held but slidings,
  Errors of rage, when custom and the world
  Calls lust a crime spotted with blackest terrors.

  _Free._ Where errors are held crimes, crimes are but errors.
  Along, sir, to her; she's an arrant strumpet; and a
  strumpet is a sarpego, venom'd gonorrhy to man--things
  actually possessed [_Offers to go out, and suddenly
  draws back_]--yet since thou art in love,--and again, as
  good make use of a statue--a body without a soul, a carcass
  three months dead--yet since thou art in love----

  _Mal._ Death, man! my destiny I cannot choose.                  142

  _Free._ Nay, I hope so. Again, they sell but only flesh,
  No jot affection; so that even in the enjoying,
  _Absentem marmoreamque putes_.[31] Yet since you needs
  must love----

  _Mal._ Unavoidable, though folly--worse than madness!

  _Free._ It's true; but since you needs must love, you
     must know this,--
  He that must love, a fool and he must kiss.

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  Master Cocledemoy, _ut vales, Domine_!                          150

  _Coc._ _Ago tibi gratias_, my worshipful friend, how does
  your friend?

  _Free._ Out, you rascal!

  _Coc._ Hang toasts, you are an ass; much o' your
  worship's brain lies in your calves; bread o' god, boy, I
  was at supper last night with a new-wean'd bulchin;
  bread o' god, drunk, horribly drunk--horribly drunk!
  there was a wench, one Frank Frailty, a punk, an honest
  polecat, of a clean instep, sound leg, smooth thigh, and
  the nimble devil in her buttock. Ah, feast o' grace!
  when saw you, Tysefew, or Master Caqueteur, that
  prattling gallant of a good draught, common customs,
  fortunate impudence, and sound fart?                            163

  _Free._ Away, rogue!

  _Coc._ Hang toasts, my fine boy, my companion as
  worshipful.

  _Mal._ Yes, I hear you are taken up with scholars and
  churchmen.

                  _Enter_ HOLIFERNES _the barber_.

  _Coc._ _Quanquam_[32] _te, Marce, fili_, my fine boy.

  _Hol._ Does[33] your worship want a barber-surgeon?             170

  _Free._ Farewell, knave; beware the Mulligrubs.

                                  [_Exeunt_ FREEVILL _and_ MALHEREUX.

  _Coc._ Let the Mulligrubs beware the knave. What, a
  barber-surgeon, my delicate boy?

  _Hol._ Yes, sir, an apprentice to surgery.

  _Coc._[34] 'Tis, my fine boy. To what bawdy-house doth
  your master belong? What's thy name?

  _Hol._ Holifernes Reinscure.

  _Coc._ Reinscure! Good Master Holifernes, I desire
  your further acquaintance; nay, pray ye be covered,
  my fine boy: kill thy itch, and heal thy scabs. Is thy
  master rotten?                                                  181

  _Hol._ My father, forsooth, is dead----

  _Coc._ _And laid in his grave.
  Alas! what comfort shall Peggy then have!_[35]

  _Hol._ None but me, sir; that's my mother's son, I
  assure you.

  _Coc._ Mother's son? A good witty boy, would live to
  read an homily well: and to whom are you going now?

  _Hol._ Marry, forsooth, to trim Master Mulligrub the
  vintner.                                                        190

  _Coc._ Do you know Master Mulligrub?

  _Hol._ My godfather, sir.

  _Coc._ Good boy: hold up thy chops. I pray thee do
  one thing for me: my name is Gudgeon.

  _Hol._ Good Master Gudgeon.

  _Coc._ Lend me thy basin, razor, and apron.

  _Hol._ O Lord, sir![36]

  _Coc._ Well spoken; good English. But what's thy
  furniture worth?

  _Hol._ O Lord, sir, I know not.                                 200

  _Coc._ Well spoken; a boy of a good wit: hold this
  pawn; where dost dwell?

  _Hol._ At the sign of the Three Razors, sir.

  _Coc._ A sign of good shaving, my catastrophonical fine
  boy. I have an odd jest to trim Master Mulligrub, for
  a wager; a jest, boy; a humour. I'll return thy things
  presently. Hold!

  _Hol._ What mean you, good Master Gudgeon?

  _Coc._ Nothing, faith, but a jest, boy: drink that; I'll
  recoil presently.                                               210

  _Hol._ You'll not stay long.

  _Coc._ As I am an honest man. The Three Razors?

  _Hol._ Ay, sir.

                                                  [_Exit_ HOLIFERNES.

  _Coc._ Good; and if I shave not Master Mulligrub, my
  wit has no edge, and I may[37] go cack in my pewter. Let
  me see,--a barber: my scurvy tongue will discover me:
  must dissemble, must disguise; for my beard, my false
  hair; for my tongue--Spanish, Dutch or Welsh--no, a
  Northern barber; very good. Widow Reinscure's man,
  well; newly entertain'd, right; so, hang toasts! all cards
  have white backs, and all knaves would seem to have
  white breasts: so proceed now, worshipful Cocledemoy.

                     [_Exit_ COCLEDEMOY, _in his barber's furniture_.

                             SCENE II.

                     _Franceschina's lodging._

       _Enter_ MARY FAUGH, _and_ FRANCESCHINA _with her hair
                          loose, chafing_.


  _Mar._ Nay, good sweet daughter, do not swagger so;
  you hear your love is to be married, true; he does cast
  you off, right; he will leave you to the world,--what then?
  though blue and white, black and green, leave you, may
  not red and yellow entertain you? is there but one
  colour in the rainbow?

  _Fra._ Grand grincome[38] on your sentences! God's
  sacrament, ten towsand divels take you!--you ha'
  brought mine love, mine honour, mine body, all to
  noting!                                                          10

  _Mar._ To nothing! I'll be sworn I have brought them
  to all the things I could; I ha' made as much o' your
  maidenhead--and you had been mine own daughter, I
  could not ha' sold your maidenhead oft'ner than I ha'
  done. I ha' sworn for you, God forgive me! I have
  made you acquainted with the Spaniard, Don Skirtoll,--with
  the Italian, Messer Beieroane,--with the Irish lord,
  S. Patrick,--with the Dutch merchant, Haunce Herkin
  Glukin Skellam Flapdragon,--and specially with the
  greatest French, and now lastly with this English, yet, in
  my conscience, an honest gentleman. And am I now
  grown one of the accursed with you for my labour? Is
  this my reward? Am I call'd bawd? Well, Mary Faugh,
  go thy ways, Mary Faugh; thy kind heart will bring thee
  to the hospital.                                                 25

  _Fra._ Nay, good naunt, you'll help me to an oder love,
  vil you not?

  _Mar._ Out, thou naughty belly! wouldst thou make
  me thy bawd?--thou'st best make me thy bawd. I ha'
  kept counsel for thee: who paid the apothecary,--was't
  not honest Mary Faugh? who redeem'd thy petticoat
  and mantle,--was't not honest Mary Faugh? who helped
  thee to thy custom,--not swaggering Ireland captains,
  nor of two-shilling inns-o'-court men,--but with honest
  flat-caps,[39] wealthy flat-caps, that pay for their pleasure
  the best of any men in Europe, nay, which is more, in
  London? And dost thou defy me, vile creature?                    37

  _Fra._ Foutra[40] pon you,--vitch, bawd, polecat,--paugh!
  Did not you praise Freevill to mine love?

  _Mar._ I did praise, I confess, I did praise him; I said
  he was a fool, an unthrift, a true whoremaster, I confess;
  a constant drab-keeper, I confess: but what, the wind is
  turn'd!

  _Fra._ It is, it is, vile woman!--reprobate woman!--naughty
  woman! it is: vat sall become of mine poor
  flesh now? mine body must turn Turk for twopence.
  O Divela, life o' mine art! ick sall be reveng'd!--do ten
  thousand hell damn me, ick sall have the rogue trote
  cut! and his love, and his friend, and all his affinity, sall
  smart! sall dye! sall hang! Now legion of devil seize
  him!--de gran pest, St. Anthony's fire, and de hot
  Neapolitan poc, rot him!                                         52

                 _Enter_ FREEVILL _and_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ Franceschina!

  _Fra._ O mine seet, dear'st, kindest, mine loving! O
  mine towsand, ten towsand, delicated, petty[41] seet art!

                                                   [_Cantat Gallic�._

  A[h] mine, a[h] dear leevest affection!

  _Free._ Why, monkey, no fashion in you! Give entertain
  to my friend.

  _Fra._ Ick sall make de most of you dat courtesy may.
  Aunt Mary, Mettre Faugh, stools, stools, for des gallants!
  _Mine mettre sing non oder song_,[42]--frolic, frolic, sir!--    61
  _but still complain me do her wrong_. Lighten your heart,
  sir; for _me did but kiss her_,--for me did but kiss her--and
  _so let go_. Your friend is very heavy; ick sall ne'er
  like such sad company.

  _Free._ No, thou delightest only in light company.

  _Fra._ By mine trot, he been very sad; vat ail you, sir?

  _Mal._ A tooth-ache, lady, a paltry rheum.

  _Fra._ De diet is very goot for de rheum.

  _Free._ How far off dwells the house-surgeon, Mary
  Faugh?                                                           71

  _Mar._ You are a profane fellow, i'faith; I little thought
  to hear such ungodly terms come from your lips.

  _Fra._ Pre de now, 'tis but a toy, a very trifle.

  _Free._ I care not for the value, Frank, but i'faith----

  _Fra._ I'fait, me must needs have it (dis is Beatrice'
  ring, oh could I get it!); seet, pre de now, as ever you
  have embraced me with a hearty arm, a warm thought,
  or a pleasing touch, as ever you will profess to love me,
  as ever you do wish me life, give me dis ring, dis little
  ring.                                                            81

  _Free._ Prithee be not uncivilly importunate; sha' not
  ha't; faith, I care not for thee, nor thy jealousy; sha'
  not ha't, i'faith.

  _Fra._ You do not love me. I hear of Sir Hubert
  Subboys' daughter, Mistress Beatrice. God's sacrament,
  ick could scratch out her eyes, and suck the holes!

  _Free._ Go; y' are grown a punk rampant!

  _Fran._ So, get thee gone; ne'er more behold min eyes,
  by thee made wretched!                                           90

  _Free._ Mary Faugh, farewell!--farewell, Frank!

  _Fra._ Sall I not ha' de ring?

  _Free._ No, by the Lord!

  _Fra._ By te Lord?

  _Free._ By the Lord!

  _Fra._ Go to your new blouze,--your unproved sluttery,--your
  modest mettre, forsooth!

  _Free._ Marry, will I, forsooth!

  _Fra._ Will you marry, forsooth?

  _Free._ Do not turn witch before thy time.--                    100
  With all my heart, sir, you will stay.

  _Mal._ I am no whit myself.  _Video meliora proboque_,
  But raging lust my fate all strong doth move;
  The gods themselves cannot be wise and love.

  _Free._ Your wishes to you!

                                                    [_Exit_ FREEVILL.

  _Mal._ Beauty entirely choice--

  _Fra._ Pray ye prove a man of fashion, and neglect
  the neglected.

  _Mal._ Can such a rarity be neglected?--can there be
  measure or sin in loving such a creature?

  _Fra._ O min poor forsaken heart!                               110

  _Mal._ I cannot contain,--he saw thee not that left thee.
  If there be wisdom, reason, honour, grace,
  Of any foolishly-esteem�d virtue,
  In giving o'er possession of such beauty,
  Let me be vicious, so I may be loved.
  Passion, I am thy slave; sweet, it shall be my grace,
  That I account thy love my only virtue:
  Shall I swear I am thy most vow�d servant?

  _Fra._ Mine vowed? Go! go! go! I cannot more of
  love. No! no! no! You bin all unconstant. O unfaithful
  men--tyrants--betrayers--de very enjoying us loseth
  us; and when you only ha' made us hateful, you only
  hate us. O mine forsaken heart!                                 123

  _Mal._ I must not rave. Silence and modesty two
  customary virtues. Will you be my mistress?

  _Fra._ Mettres? Ha! ha! ha!

  _Mal._ Will you lie with me?

  _Fra._ Lie with you? O no; you men will out-lie any
  woman; fait, me no more can love.

  _Mal._ No matter, let me enjoy your bed.                        130

  _Fra._ O! vile man, vat do you tinck on me? Do you
  take me to be a beast--a creature that for sense only
  will entertain love, and not only for love--love? O!
  brutish abomination!

  _Mal._ Why, then I pray thee love, and with thy love
  enjoy me----

  _Fra._ Give me reason to affect you. Will you swear
  you love me?

  _Mal._ So seriously, that I protest no office so dangerous--no
  deed so unreasonable--no cost so heavy, but I vow
  to the utmost tentation of my best being to effect it.          141

  _Fra._ Sall I, or can I trust again? O fool!
  How natural 'tis for us to be abused!
  Sall ick be sure that no satiety,
  No enjoying,
  Not time shall languish your affection?

  _Mal._ If there be ought in brain, heart, or hand,
  Can make you doubtless, I am your vow'd servant.

  _Fra._ Will you do one ting for me?

  _Mal._ Can I do it?                                             150

  _Fra._ Yes, yes; but ick do not love dis same Freevill.

  _Mal._ Well?

  _Fra._ Nay, I do hate him.

  _Mal._ So.

  _Fra._ By this kiss I hate him.

  _Mal._ I love to feel such oaths; swear again.

  _Fra._ No, no. Did you ever hear of any that loved at
  the first sight?

  _Mal._ A thing most proper.

  _Fra._ Now fait, I judge it all incredible until this hour
  I saw you: pretty fair-eyed yout, would you enjoy
  me?                                                             162

  _Mal._ Rather than my breath, even as my being.

  _Fra._ Vel! had ick not made a vow----

  _Mal._ What vow?

  _Fra._ O let me forget it; it makes us both despair!

  _Mal._ Dear soul, what vow?

  _Fra._ Ha, good morrow, gentle sir; endeavour to forget
  me, as I must be enforced to forget all men. Sweet
  mind rest in you.                                               170

  _Mal._ Stay, let not thy desire burst me. O my
  impatient heat endures no resistance--no protraction!
  there is no being for me but your sudden enjoying.

  _Fra._ I do not love Freevill.

  _Mal._ But what vow? what vow?

  _Fra._ So long as Freevill lives, I must not love.

  _Mal._ Then he--

  _Fra._ Must--

  _Mal._ Die!

  _Fra._ I [k]no[w] there is no such vehemence in your affects.   180
  Would I were anything, so he were not!

  _Mal._ Will you be mine when he is not?

  _Fra._ Will I? Dear, dear breast, by this most zealous
  kiss! but I will not persuade you; but if you hate him
  that I loathe most deadly; yet as you please--I'll
  persuade noting.

  _Mal._ Will you be only mine?

  _Fra._ Vill I? How hard 'tis for true love to dissemble.
  I am only yours.

  _Mal._ 'Tis as irrevocable as breath: he dies.                  190
  Your love!

  _Fra._ My vow,--not until he be dead;
  Which that I may be sure not to infringe,
  Dis token of his death sall satisfy:
  He has a ring, as dear as the air to him,
  His new love's gift; tat got and brought to me,
  I shall assur�d your profess�d rest.

  _Mal._ To kill a man?

  _Fra._ O! done safely; a quarrel sudden pick'd,
  With an advantage strike--then bribe--a little coin,
  All's safe, dear soul; but I'll not set you on.                 200

  _Mal._ Nay, he is gone--the ring! Well, come, little
  more liberal of thy love.

  _Fra._ Not yet; my vow.

  _Mal._ O Heaven! there is no hell but love's prolongings.
  Dear, farewell.

  _Fra._ Farewell.
  Now does my heart swell high, for my revenge
  Has birth and form; first friend sall kill his friend.
  He dat survives I'll hang; besides de chaste
  Beatrice I'll vex. Only de ring;                                210
  Dat got, the world sall know the worst of evils:
  Woman corrupted is the worst of devils.

                                                [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Mal._ To kill my friend! O 'tis to kill myself!
  Yet man's but man's excrement--man breeding man
  As he does worms; or this, to spoil this nothing.

                                                         [_He spits._

  The body of a man is of the self-same mould[43]
  As ox or horse; no murder to kill these.
  As for that only part which makes us man,
  Murder wants power to touch't. O wit, how vile!
  How hellish art thou, when thou raisest nature                  220
  'Gainst sacred faith! Think more: to kill a friend
  To gain a woman! to lose a virtuous self
  For appetite and sensual end, whose very having
  Loseth all appetite, and gives satiety!
  That corporal end, remorse and inward blushings,
  Forcing us loathe the steam of our own heats;
  Whilst friendship closed in virtue, being spiritual,
  Tastes no such languishings, and moments' pleasure
  With much repentance; but like rivers flow,
  And further that they run they bigger grow.                     230
  Lord, how was I misgone! how easy 'tis to err,
  When passion will not give us leave to think!
  A learn'd, that is an honest man, may fear,
  And lust, and rage, and malice,[44] and anything,
  When he is taken uncollected suddenly:
  'Tis sin of cold blood, mischief with waked eyes,
  That is the damn�d and the truly[45] vice;
  Not he that's passionless, but he 'bove passion's wise.
  My friend shall know it all.

                                                             [_Exit._

                             SCENE III.

                            _A Tavern._

         _Enter_ Master MULLIGRUB _and_ Mistress MULLIGRUB,
                _she with a bag of money_.


  _Mistress Mul._ It is right, I assure you, just fifteen
  pounds.

  _Mul._ Well, Cocledemoy, 'tis thou putt'st me to this
  charge; but, and I catch thee, I'll charge thee with as
  many irons. Well, is the barber come? I'll be trimm'd,
  and then to Cheapside to buy a fair piece of plate, to
  furnish the loss. Is the barber come?

  _Mistress Mul._ Truth, husband, surely heaven is not
  pleased with our vocation. We do wink at the sins of
  our people. Our wines are protestants; and I speak
  it to my grief, and to the burthen of my conscience, we
  fry our fish with salt butter.                                   12

  _Mul._ Go, look to your business; mend the matter,
  and score false with a vengeance.

                                          [_Exit_ Mistress MULLIGRUB.

                _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY _like a barber_.

  Welcome, friend, whose man?

  _Coc._ Widow Reinscure's man; and shall please your
  good worship, my name's Andrew Shark.

  _Mul._ How does my godson, good Andrew?

  _Coc._ Very well, he's gone to trim Master Quicquid,
  our parson. Hold up your head.                                   20

  _Mul._ How long have you been a barber, Andrew?

  _Coc._ Not long, sir; this two year.

  _Mul._ What! and a good workman already. I dare
  scarce trust my head to thee.

  _Coc._ O, fear not; we ha' poll'd better men than you;
  we learn the trade very quickly. Will your good worship
  be shaven or cut?

  _Mul._ As you will. What trade didst live by before
  thou turnedst barber, Andrew?

  _Coc._ I was a pedlar in Germany; but my countrymen
  thrive better by this trade.                                     31

  _Mul._ What's the news, barber? thou art sometimes at
  court.

  _Coc._ Sometimes poll a page or so, sir.

  _Mul._ And what's the news? How do all my good
  lords and all my good ladies, and all the rest of my
  acquaintance?

  _Coc._ What an arrogant knave's this! I'll acquaintance
  ye! 'Tis cash!--[_He spieth the bag._]--Say ye, sir?

  _Mul._ And what news--what news, good Andrew?                    40

  _Coc._ Marry, sir, you know the Conduit at Greenwich,
  and the under-holes that spouts up water?

  _Mul._ Very well; I was wash'd there one day, and so
  was my wife--you might have wrung her smock, i'faith!
  But what o' those holes?

  _Coc._ Thus, sir. Out of those little holes, in the midst
  of the night, crawl'd out twenty-four huge, horrible, monstrous,
  fearful, devouring----

  _Mul._ Bless us!                                                 49

  _Coc._ Serpents, which no sooner were beheld, but they
  turn'd to mastiffs, which howl'd; those mastiffs instantly
  turn'd to cocks, which crowed; those cocks, in a moment,
  were changed to bears, which roar'd; which bears are at
  this hour to be yet seen in Paris Garden, living upon
  nothing but toasted cheese and green onions.

  _Mul._ By the Lord! and this may be, my wife and I
  will go see them. This portends something.

  _Coc._ [_aside._] Yes, worshipful fist,[46] thou'st feel what
  portends by and by.                                              59

  _Mul._ And what more news? You shave the world--especially
  you barber-surgeons--you know the ground of
  many things. You are cunning privy searchers: by the
  mass, you scour all. What more news?

  _Coc._ They say, sir, that twenty-five couple of Spanish
  jennets are to be seen, hand in hand, dance the old
  measures,[47] whilst six goodly Flaunders mares play to
  them on a noise[48] of flutes.

  _Mul._ O monstrous! this is a lie o' my word. Nay,
  and this be not a lie--I am no fool, I warrant--nay,
  make an ass of me once?                                          70

  _Coc._ Shut your eyes close--wink; sure, sir, this ball
  will make you smart.

  _Mul._ I do wink.

  _Coc._ Your head will take cold;

              [COCLEDEMOY _puts on a coxcomb on_ MULLIGRUB'S _head_.]

  I will put on your good worship's nightcap whilst I
  shave you. So, mum, hang toasts! Faugh, _via!_[49] sparrows
  must peck and Cocledemoy munch.                                  77

  _Mul._ Ha, ha, ha! Twenty-five couple of Spanish
  jennets to dance the old measures. Andrew makes my
  worship laugh, i'faith. Dost take me for an ass, Andrew?--dost
  know one Cocledemoy in town? He made me an
  ass last night, but I'll ass him! Art thou free, Andrew?
  Shave me well--I shall be one of the common council
  shortly--and then, Andrew--why, Andrew, Andrew,
  dost leave me in the suds?

                              CANTAT.

  Why, Andrew, I shall be blind with winking. Ha!
  Andrew--wife--Andrew, what means this? Wife!--my
  money, wife!                                                     88

                    _Enter_ Mistress MULLIGRUB.

  _Mistress Mul._ What's the noise with you? What ail
  you?

  _Mul._ Where's the barber?

  _Mistress Mul._ Gone. I saw him depart long since.
  Why, are not you trimm'd?

  _Mul._ Trimm'd! O wife! I am shaved. Did you
  take hence the money?

  _Mistress Mul._ I touch'd it not, as I am religious.

  _Mul._ O Lord! I have wink'd fair.

                        _Enter_ HOLIFERNES.

  _Hol._ I pray, godfather, give me your blessing.

  _Mul._ O Holifernes--O where's thy mother's Andrew?             100

  _Hol._ Blessing, godfather!

  _Mul._ The devil choke thee! where's Andrew, thy
  mother's man?

  _Hol._ My mother hath none such, forsooth.

  _Mul._ My money--fifteen pounds--plague of all Andrews!
  who was't trimm'd me?

  _Hol._ I know not, godfather; only one met me, as I
  was coming to you, and borrowed my furniture, as he
  said, for a jest' sake.

  _Mul._ What kind of fellow?                                     110

  _Hol._ A thick, elderly, stub-bearded fellow.

  _Mul._ Cocledemoy, Cocledemoy! Raise all the wise
  men in the street! I'll hang him with mine own hands!
  O wife! some _rosa solis_.[50]

  _Mistress Mul._ Good husband, take comfort in the
  Lord; I'll play the devil, but I'll recover it. Have a
  good conscience, 'tis but a week's cutting[51] in the term!

  _Mul._ O, wife! O, wife! O, Jack! how does thy
  mother? Is there any fiddlers in the house?

  _Mistress Mul._ Yes, Master Creak's[52] noise?                  120

  _Mul._ Bid 'em play, laugh, make merry; cast up my
  accounts, for I'll go hang myself presently. I will not
  curse, but a pox on Cocledemoy; he has poll'd and
  shaved me, he has trimm'd me!

                                                           [_Exeunt._


     [46] Old eds. "fiest." _Fist_ is a term of contempt (= fister,

     [50] A cordial.

     [51] Mistress Mulligrub consoles her husband with the thought
     that in one week of term-time the fifteen pounds may be recovered
     by help of a little _sharping_ (in the way of adulterating the
     liquors, frothing the cans, &c.).

                              ACT III.


                              SCENE I.

               _Room in_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

         _Enter_ BEATRICE, CRISPINELLA _and_ Nurse PUTIFER.


  _Put._ Nay, good child o' love, once more Master Freevill's
  sonnet o' the kiss you gave him.

  _Bea._ Sha't, good nurse:

                                                            [_Sings._

            _Purest lips, soft banks of blisses,
             Self alone deserving kisses;
             O give me leave to_, &c.

  _Cri._ Pish! sister Beatrice, prithee read no more; my
  stomach o' late stands against kissing extremely.

  _Bea._ Why, good Crispinella?                                     9

  _Cri._ By the faith and trust I bear to my face, 'tis
  grown one of the most unsavoury ceremonies: body
  o' beauty! 'tis one of the most unpleasing injurious
  customs to ladies: any fellow that has but one nose on
  his face, and standing collar and skirts also lined with
  taffety sarcenet, must salute us on the lips as familiarly--Soft
  skins save us! there was a stub-bearded John-a-Stile
  with a ployden's face saluted me last day and struck his
  bristles through my lips; I ha' spent ten shillings in
  pomatum since to skin them again. Marry, if a nobleman
  or a knight with one lock visit us, though his unclean
  goose-turd-green[53] teeth ha' the palsy, his nostrils smell
  worse than a putrified marrowbone, and his loose beard
  drops into our bosom, yet we must kiss him with a cursy,
  a curse! for my part, I had as lieve they would break
  wind in my lips.                                                 25

  _Bea._ Fie, Crispinella, you speak too broad.

  _Cri._ No jot, sister; let's ne'er be ashamed to speak
  what we be not ashamed to think: I dare as boldly
  speak venery as think venery.

  _Bea._ Faith, sister! I'll begone if you speak so broad.

  _Cri._ Will you so? Now bashfulness seize you, we
  pronounce boldly, robbery, murder, treason, which
  deeds must needs be far more loathsome than an act
  which is so natural, just, and necessary, as that of procreation;
  you shall have an hypocritical vestal virgin
  speak that with close teeth publicly, which she will
  receive with open mouth privately; for my own part, I
  consider nature without apparel; without disguising of
  custom or compliment, I give thoughts words, and
  words truth, and truth boldness; she whose honest
  freeness makes it her virtue to speak what she thinks
  will make it her necessity to think what is good. I love
  no prohibited things, and yet I would have nothing
  prohibited by policy, but by virtue; for as in the fashion
  of time those books that are call'd in are most in sale
  and request,[54] so in nature those actions that are most
  prohibited are most desired.                                     47

  _Bea._ Good quick sister, stay your pace; we are
  private, but the world would censure you, for truly
  severe modesty is women's virtue.

  _Cri._ Fie, fie! virtue is a free, pleasant, buxom quality.
  I love a constant countenance well; but this froward
  ignorant coyness, sour austere lumpish uncivil privateness,
  that promises nothing but rough skins and
  hard stools; ha! fie on't, good for nothing but for
  nothing. Well, nurse, and what do you conceive of
  all this?                                                        57

  _Put._ Nay, faith, my conceiving days be done. Marry
  for kissing, I'll defend that; that's within my compass;
  but for my own part, here's Mistress Beatrice is to be
  married with the grace of God; a fine gentleman he is
  shall have her, and I warrant a strong; he has a leg like
  a post, a nose like a lion, a brow like a bull, and a
  beard of most fair expectation: this week you must
  marry him, and I now will read a lecture to you both,
  how you shall behave yourselves to your husbands the
  first month of your nuptial; I ha' broke my skull about
  it, I can tell you, and there is much brain in it.

  _Cri._ Read it to my sister, good nurse, for I assure
  you I'll ne'er marry.                                            70

  _Put._ Marry, God forfend, what will you do then?

  _Cri._ Faith, strive against the flesh. Marry! no,
  faith, husbands are like lots in the lottery: you may
  draw forty blanks before you find one that has any prize
  in him. A husband generally is a careless, domineering
  thing, that grows like coral, which as long as it is under
  water is soft and tender, but as soon as it has got his
  branch above the waves is presently hard, stiff, not to be
  bowed but burst; so when your husband is a suitor and
  under your choice, Lord how supple he is, how obsequious,
  how at your service, sweet lady! Once married,
  got up his head above, a stiff, crooked, nobby, inflexible
  tyrannous creature he grows; then they turn like water,
  more you would embrace the less you hold. I'll live
  my own woman, and if the worst come to the worst, I
  had rather prove a wag than a fool.                              86

  _Bea._ O, but a virtuous marriage.

  _Cri._ Virtuous marriage! there is no more affinity
  betwixt virtue and marriage than betwixt a man and his
  horse; indeed virtue gets up upon marriage sometimes,
  and manageth it in the right way; but marriage is of
  another piece, for as a horse may be without a man, and
  a man without a horse, so marriage, you know, is often
  without virtue, and virtue, I am sure, more oft without
  marriage. But thy match, sister--by my troth I think
  'twill do well; he's a well-shaped, clean-lipp'd gentleman,
  of a handsome, but not affected, fineness, a good
  faithful eye, and a well-humour'd cheek; would he did
  not stoop in the shoulders, for thy sake. See, here he is.

                  _Enter_ FREEVILL _and_ TYSEFEW.

  _Free._ Good day, sweet!                                        100

  _Cri._ Good morrow, brother! nay, you shall have my
  lip. Good morrow, servant!

  _Tyse._ Good morrow, sweet life!

  _Cri._ Life! dost call thy mistress life?

  _Tyse._ Life! yes, why not life?

  _Cri._ How many mistresses hast thou?

  _Tyse._ Some nine.

  _Cri._ Why then thou hast nine lives, like a cat.

  _Tyse._ Mew, you would be taken up for that.                    109

  _Cri._ Nay, good, let me still sit; we low statures love
  still to sit, lest when we stand we may be supposed to
  sit.

  _Tyse._ Dost not wear high cork shoes--chopines?[55]

  _Cri._ Monstrous ones: I am, as many other are,
  pieced above and pieced beneath.

  _Tyse._ Still the best part in the----

  _Cri._ And yet all will scarce make me so high as one
  of the giants'[56] stilts that stalks before my Lord Mayor's
  pageant:

  _Tyse._ By the Lord, so I thought 'twas for something
  Mistress Joyce jested at thy high insteps.                      121

  _Cri._ She might well enough, and long enough, before
  I would be ashamed of my shortness: what I made or
  can mend myself I may blush at; but what nature put
  upon me, let her be ashamed for me, I ha' nothing to do
  with it. I forget my beauty.

  _Tyse._ Faith, Joyce is a foolish bitter creature.

  _Cri._ A pretty mildewed wench she is.

  _Tyse._ And fair----

  _Cri._ As myself!                                               130

  _Tyse._ O you forget your beauty now.

  _Cri._ Troth, I never remember my beauty, but as some
  men do religion,--for controversy's sake.

  _Bea._ A motion,[57] sister.

  _Cri._ Nineveh,[58] Julius C�sar, Jonas, or the destruction
  of Jerusalem.

  _Bea._ My love, hear.

  _Cri._ Prithee call him not love, 'tis the drab's phrase:
  nor sweet honey, nor my coney, nor dear duckling,
  they[59] are citizen terms, but call him----                    140

  _Bea._ What?

  _Cri._ Anything.--What's the motion?

  _Bea._ You know this night our parents have intended
  solemnly to contract us, and my love, to grace the feast,
  hath promised a masque.

  _Free._ You'll make one, Tysefew, and Caqueteur shall
  fill up a room.

  _Tyse._ 'Fore heaven, well-remember'd; he borrowed a
  diamond of me last night to grace his finger in your
  visitation. The lying creature will swear some strange
  thing on it now.                                                151

                    _Enter_ CAQUETEUR.

  _Cri._ Peace, he's here; stand close, lurk.

  _Caq._ Good morrow, most dear, and worthy to be
  most wise. How does my mistress?

  _Cri._ Morrow, sweet servant; you glister,--prithee,
  let's see that stone.

  _Caq._ A toy, lady, I bought to please my finger.

  _Cri._ Why, I am more precious to you than your
  finger.

  _Caq._ Yes, or than all my body, I swear.                       160

  _Cri._ Why, then let it be bought to please me; come,
  I am no professed beggar.

  _Caq._ Troth, mistress! Zoons! Forsooth, I protest!

  _Cri._ Nay, if you turn Protestant for such a toy.

  _Caq._ In good deed, la; another time I'll give you
  a----

  _Cri._ Is this yours to give?

  _Caq._ O God! forsooth mine, quoth you; nay, as for
  that----                                                        170

  _Cri._ Now I remember, I ha' seen this on my servant
  Tysefew's finger.

  _Caq._ Such another.

  _Cri._ Nay, I am sure this is it.

  _Caq._ Troth, 'tis forsooth. The poor fellow wanted
  money to pay for supper last night, and so pawn'd it to
  me; 'tis a pawn, i'faith, or else you should have it.

  _Tyse._ Hark ye, thou base lying--How dares thy impudence
  hope to prosper? Were't not for the privilege
  of this respected company, I would so bang thee.                180

  _Cri._ Come hither, servant. What's the matter betwixt
  you two?

  _Caq._ Nothing; but hark you, he did me some uncivil
  discourtesies last night; for which, because I should not
  call him to account, he desires to make me any satisfaction.
  The coward trembles at my very presence;
  but I ha' him on the hip; I'll take the forfeit on his
  ring.

  _Tyse._ What's that you whisper to her?                         189

  _Caq._ Nothing, sir; but satisfy her that the ring was
  not pawn'd, but only lent by you to grace my finger;
  and so told her I craved pardon for being too familiar,
  or indeed over-bold with your reputation.

  _Cri._ Yes, indeed, he did. He said you desired to
  make him any satisfaction for an uncivil discourtesy you
  did him last night; but he said he had you o' the hip,
  and would take the forfeit of your ring.

  _Tyse._ How now, ye base poltroon.

  _Caq._ Hold! hold! my mistress speaks by contraries.

  _Tyse._ Contraries!                                             200

  _Caq._ She jests--faith, only jests.

  _Cri._ Sir, I'll no more o' your service--you are a child--I'll
  give you to my nurse.

  _Put._ And he come to me, I can tell you, as old as I
  am, what to do with him.

  _Caq._ I offer my service, forsooth.

  _Tyse._ Why, so: now, every dog has his bone to
  gnaw on.

  _Free._ The masque holds, Master Caqueteur.

  _Caq._ I am ready, sir. Mistress, I'll dance with you,
  ne'er fear--I'll grace you.                                     211

  _Put._ I tell you, I can my singles and my doubles, and
  my trick o' twenty[60]--my carantapace--my traverse forward--and
  my falling back, yet, i'faith.

  _Bea._ Mine! The provision for the night is ours.
  Much must be our care; till night we leave you;
  I am your servant, be not tyrannous.
  Your virtue won me; faith, my love's not lust;
  Good, wrong me not; my most fault is much trust.

  _Free._ Until night only, my heart be with you. Farewell,
  sister.                                                         221

  _Cri._ Adieu, brother. Come on, sister, for these
  sweetmeats.

  _Free._ Let's meet and practise presently.

  _Tyse._ Content; we'll but fit our pumps. Come, ye
  pernicious vermin.

                                           [_Exeunt all but_ FREEVILL.

                   _Enter_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ My friend, wished hours! What news from Babylon?
  How does the woman of sin and natural concupiscence?

  _Mal._ The eldest child of nature ne'er beheld
  So damn'd a creature.                                           230

  _Free._ What! _In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas?_
  Which way bears the tide?

  _Mal._ Dear loved sir, I find a mind courageously
  vicious may be put on a desperate security; but can
  never be blessed with a firm enjoying and self-satisfaction.

  _Free._ What passion is this, my dear Lindabrides?[61]

  _Mal._ 'Tis well; we both may jest; I ha' been tempted
  to your death.

  _Free._ What, is the rampant cocatrice grown mad for
  the loss of her men?                                            241

  _Mal._ Devilishly mad.

  _Free._ As most assured of my second love?

  _Mal._ Right.

  _Free._ She would have had this ring.

  _Mal._ Ay, and this heart; and in true proof you were
  slain, I should bring her this ring, from which she was
  assured
  You would not part until from life you parted;
  For which deed, and only for which deed, I should
  possess her sweetness.                                          251

  _Free._ O! bloody villains! Nothing is defamed but
  by his proper self. Physicians abuse remedies; lawyers
  spoil the law; and women only shame women. You
  ha' vow'd my death?

  _Mal._ My lust, not I, before my reason would; yet I
  must use her. That I, a man of sense, should conceive
  endless pleasure in a body whose soul I know to be so
  hideously black!                                                259

  _Free._ That a man at twenty-three should cry, O sweet
  pleasure! and at forty-three should sigh, O sharp pox!
  But consider man furnished with omnipotence, and you
  overthrow him; thou must cool thy impatient appetite.
  'Tis fate, 'tis fate!

  _Mal._ I do malign my creation that I am subject to
  passion. I must enjoy her.

  _Free._ I have it, mark. I give a masque to-night
  To my love's kindred; in that thou shalt go.
  In that we two make show of falling out.
  Give seeming challenge--instantly depart,                       270
  With some suspicion to present fight.
  We will be seen as going to our swords;
  And after meeting, this ring only lent,
  I'll lurk in some obscure place, till rumour
  (The common bawd to loose suspicions)
  Have feign'd me slain, which (in respect myself
  Will not be found, and our late seeming quarrel)
  Will quickly sound to all as earnest truth.
  Then to thy wench; protest me surely dead;
  Show her this ring, enjoy her, and, blood cold,                 280
  We'll laugh at folly.

  _Mal._ O but think of it!

  _Free._ Think of it! come away; virtue, let sleep thy passions;
  What old times held as crimes, are now but fashions.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

             _House of_ Master BURNISH, _the jeweller_.

  _Enter_ Master BURNISH[62] _and_ LIONEL. Master MULLIGRUB, _with a
     standing cup in his hand, and an obligation[63] in the other_.
     COCLEDEMOY _stands at the other door, disguised like a French
     pedlar, and overhears them_.


  _Mul._ I am not at this time furnish'd; but there's my
  bond for your plate.

  _Bur._ Your bill had been sufficient: y'are a good[64]
  man. A standing cup parcel-gilt[65] of thirty-two ounces,
  eleven pounds seven shillings, the first of July. Good
  plate--good man--good day--good all.

  _Mul._ 'Tis my hard fortune; I will hang the knave.
  No, first he shall half rot in fetters in the dungeon--his
  conscience made despairful. I'll hire a knave o' purpose--shall
  assure him he is damn'd; and after see him with
  mine own eyes, hang'd without singing any psalm. Lord,
  that he has but one neck!                                        12

  _Bur._ You are too tyrannous;--you'll use me no
  further?

  _Mul._ No, sir; lend me your servant, only to carry the
  plate home. I have occasion of an hour's absence.

  _Bur._ With easy consent, sir.--Haste and be careful.

                                                     [_Exit_ BURNISH.

  _Mul._ Be very careful, I pray thee,--to my wife's own
  hands.

  _Lio._ Secure yourself, sir.                                     20

  _Mul._ To her own hand!

  _Lio._ Fear not, I have delivered greater things than
  this to a woman's own hand.

  _Coc._ Mounsier, please you to buy a fine delicate ball,
  sweet ball--a camphor ball?

  _Mul._ Prithee, away!

                                                      [_Exit_ LIONEL.

  _Coc._ Wun'[66] a ball to scour--a scouring ball--a ball to
  be shaved!

  _Mul._ For the love of God! talk not of shaving. I
  have been shaved--mischief and a thousand devils seize
  him!--I have been shaved!                                        31

                                                   [_Exit_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Coc._ The fox grows fat when he is cursed--I'll shave
  ye smoother yet. Turd on a tile stone! my lips have a
  kind of rheum at this bole. I'll have't--I'll gargalise
  my throat with this vintner, and when I have done with
  him, spit him out. I'll shark! Conscience does not
  repine. Were I to bite an honest gentleman, a poor
  grogaran poet, or a penurious parson that had but ten
  pigs' tails in a twelvemonth, and, for want of learning, had
  but one good stool in a fortnight, I were damn'd beyond
  the works of supererogation; but to wring the withers of
  my gouty-barm'd spiggod-frigging jumbler of elements,
  Mulligrub, I hold it as lawful as sheep-shearing, taking
  eggs from hens, caudles from asses, or butter'd shrimps
  from horses--they make no use of them, were not provided
  for them. And, therefore, worshipful Cocledemoy,
  hang toasts! On, in grace and virtue to proceed,
  only beware, beware degrees. There be rounds in a
  ladder, and knots in a halter; ware carts, hang toasts,
  the common council has decreed it! I must draw a lot
  for the great goblet.                                            51

                             SCENE III.

                            _A Tavern._

     _Enter_ Mistress MULLIGRUB, _and_ LIONEL _with a goblet_.


  _Mistress Mul._ Nay, I pray you, stay and drink; and
  how does your mistress? I know her very well--I have
  been inward with her, and so has many more. She was
  ever a good, patient creature, i'faith! With all my
  heart, I'll remember your master, an honest man. He
  knew me before I was married! An honest man he is,
  and a crafty. He comes forward in the world well, I
  warrant him; and his wife is a proper woman, that she
  is. Well, she has been as proper a woman as any in
  Cheap. She paints now, and yet she keeps her husband's
  old customers to him still. In troth, a fine-faced
  wife, in a wainscot-carved seat,[67] is a worthy ornament
  to a tradesman's shop, and an attractive, I warrant; her
  husband shall find it in the custom of his ware, I'll
  assure him. God be with you, good youth; I acknowledge
  the receipt. [_Exit_ LIONEL.] I acknowledge all the
  receipt--sure, 'tis very well spoken--I acknowledge the
  receipt. Thus 'tis to have good education, and to be
  brought up in a tavern. I do keep as gallant and as
  good company, though I say it, as any she in London.
  Squires, gentlemen, and knights diet at my table, and I
  do lend some of them money; and full many fine men
  go upon my score, as simple as I stand here, and I trust
  them; and truly they very knightly and courtly promise
  fair, give me very good words, and a piece of flesh when
  time of year serves. Nay, though my husband be a
  citizen, and's cap's made of wool,[68] yet I ha' wit, and
  can see my good as soon as another, for I have all the
  thanks; my silly husband, alas! he knows nothing of
  it; 'tis I that bear--'tis I that must bear a brain[69] for all.

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ Fair hour to you, mistress!                               31

  _Mistress Mul._ Fair hour!--fine term!--faith, I'll score
  it up anon.--A beautiful thought to you, sir.

  _Coc._ Your husband, and my master, Mr. Burnish,[70]
  has sent you a jole of fresh salmon, and they both will
  come to dinner to season your new cup with the best
  wine, which cup your husband entreats you to send back
  by me, that his arms may be graved a' the side, which
  he forgot before it was sent.

  _Mistress Mul._ By what token are you sent?--by no
  token? Nay, I have wit.                                          41

  _Coc._ He sent me by the same token, that he was dry
  shaved this morning.

  _Mistress Mul._ A sad token, but true. Here, sir, I
  pray you commend me to your master, but especially to
  your mistress. Tell them they shall be most sincerely
  welcome.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Coc._ Shall be most sincerely welcome! Worshipful
  Cocledemoy, lurk close. Hang toasts! Be not ashamed
  of thy quality! Every man's turd smells well in's own
  nose. Vanish, foyst!                                             51

                                                             [_Exit._

         _Re-enter_ Mistress MULLIGRUB, _with servants and
                     furniture for the table_.

  _Mistress Mul._ Come, spread these table diaper napkins,
  and--do you hear--perfume this parlour; does so
  smell of profane tobacco. I could never endure this
  ungodly tobacco, since one of our elders assured me,
  upon his knowledge, tobacco was not used in the congregation
  of the family of love. Spread, spread handsomely--Lord?
  these boys do things arsy-versy--you
  show your bringing up. I was a gentlewoman by my
  sister's side--I can tell ye so methodically. Methodically!
  I wonder where I got that word? O! Sir
  Aminadab Ruth bad me kiss him methodically!--I had
  it somewhere, and I had it indeed.                               63

                     _Enter_ Master MULLIGRUB.

  _Mul._ Mind, be not desperate; I'll recover all.
  All things with me shall seem honest that can be profitable,
  He must ne'er winch, that would or thrive or save,
  To be call'd niggard, cuckold, cut-throat, knave!

  _Mistress Mul._ Are they come, husband?

  _Mul._ Who?--what?--how now? What feast towards
  in my private parlour?                                           70

  _Mistress Mul._ Pray leave your foolery! What, are
  they come?

  _Mul._ Come--who come?

  _Mistress Mul._ You need not make't so strange!

  _Mul._ Strange?

  _Mistress Mul._ Ay, strange. You know no man that
  sent me word that he and his wife would come to dinner
  to me, and sent this jole of fresh salmon beforehand?

  _Mul._ Peace--not I--peace! The messenger hath
  mistaken the house; let's eat it up quickly before it be
  inquired for. Sit to it--some vinegar--quick! Some
  good luck yet. Faith, I never tasted salmon relish
  better! Oh! when a man feeds at other men's cost!                83

  _Mistress Mul._ Other men's cost! Why, did not you
  send this jole of salmon?

  _Mul._ No.

  _Mistress Mul._ By Master Burnish'[71] man?

  _Mul._ No.

  _Mistress Mul._ Sending me word that he and his wife
  would come to dinner to me?                                      90

  _Mul._ No, no.

  _Mistress Mul._ To season my new bowl?

  _Mul._ Bowl!

  _Mistress Mul._ And withal will'd me to send the bowl
  back.

  _Mul._ Back!

  _Mistress Mul._ That you might have your arms graved
  on the side?

  _Mul._ Ha!

  _Mistress Mul._ By the same token you were dry-shaven
  this morning before you went forth.                             101

  _Mul._ Pah! how this salmon stinks!

  _Mistress Mul._ And thereupon sent the bowl back,
  prepar'd dinner--nay, and I bear not a brain.

  _Mul._ Wife, do not vex me! Is the bowl gone?--is
  it deliver'd?

  _Mistress Mul._ Deliver'd! Yes, sure, 'tis deliver'd.

  _Mul._ I will never more say my prayers. Do not
  make me mad; 'tis common. Let me not cry like a
  woman. Is it gone?                                              110

  _Mistress Mul._ Gone? God is my witness, I deliver'd
  it with no more intention to be cozen'd on't than the
  child new born; and yet----

  _Mul._ Look to my house! I am haunted with evil
  spirits! Hear me; do hear me! If I have not my
  goblet again, heaven! I'll to the devil,--I'll to a conjurer.
  Look to my house! I'll raise all the wise men
  i' the street.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Mistress Mul._ Deliver us! What words are these? I
  trust in God he is but drunk, sure.                             120

                       _Re-enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ I must have the salmon too; worship[ful] Cocledemoy,
  now for the masterpiece. God bless thy neckpiece,
  and foutra!--Fair mistress, my master----

  _Mistress Mul._ Have I caught you?--what, Roger?

  _Coc._ Peace, good mistress. I'll tell you all. A jest;
  a very mere jest: your husband only took sport to
  fright you:--the bowl's at my master's; and there is
  your husband, who sent me in all haste lest you should
  be over-frighted with his feigning, to come to dinner to
  him.                                                            130

  _Mistress Mul._ Praise heaven it is no worse.

  _Coc._ And desired me to desire you to send the jole of
  salmon before, and yourself to come after to them; my
  mistress would be right glad to see you.

  _Mistress Mul._ I pray carry it.  Now thank them
  entirely. Bless me, I was never so out of my skin in
  my life! pray thank your mistress most entirely.

  _Coc._ So now, figo! worshipful Mall Faugh and I will
  munch; cheaters and bawds go together like washing
  and wringing.                                                   140

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Mistress Mul._ Beshrew his heart for his labour, how
  everything about[72] me quivers. What, Christian! my
  hat and aporn:[73] here, take my sleeves. And how I
  tremble! so I'll gossip it now for't, that's certain; here
  has been revolutions and false fires indeed.

                         _Enter_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Mul._ Whither now?--what's the matter with you now?--whither
  are you a-gadding?

  _Mistress Mul._ Come, come, play the fool no more.
  Will you go?

  _Mul._ Whither, in the rank name of madness--whither?

  _Mistress Mul._ Whither?--why to Master Burnish,[74] to
  eat the jole of salmon. Lord, how strange you make
  it!                                                             153

  _Mul._ Why so?--why so?

  _Mistress Mul._ Why so? Why, did not you send the
  self-same fellow for the jole of salmon that had the cup?

  _Mul._ 'Tis well,--'tis very well.

  _Mistress Mul._ And will'd me to come and eat it with
  you at the goldsmith's?

  _Mul._ O, ay, ay, ay,--art in thy right wits?                   160

  _Mistress Mul._ Do you hear?--make a fool of somebody
  else; and you make an ass of me, I'll make an ox
  of you,--do ye see?

  _Mul._ Nay, wife, be patient; for, look you, I may be
  mad, or drunk, or so; for my own part, though you can
  bear more than I, yet I can do well. I will not curse
  nor cry,[75] but Heaven knows what I think. Come, let's
  go hear some music; I will never more say my prayers.
  Let's go hear some doleful music. Nay, if Heaven forget
  to prosper knaves, I'll go no more to the synagogue.
  Now I am discontented, I'll turn sectary; that is fashion.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

               _Room in_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

          _Enter_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS, Sir LIONEL FREEVILL,
                CRISPINELLA; _servants with lights_.


  _Sir Hub._ More lights! Welcome, Sir Lionel Freevill!
  brother Freevill, shortly. Look to your lights!

  _Serv._ The masquers are at hand.

  _Sir Lio._ Call down our daughter. Hark! they are at
  hand: rank handsomely.

  _Enter the Masquers; they dance._ _Enter_ BEATRICE, FREEVILL,
     _and_ MALHEUREUX. MALHEUREUX _takes_ BEATRICE _from_ FREEVILL:

  _Free._ So.

  your fortune.                                                    11

  _Sir Lio._ What sudden flaw is risen?

  _Sir Hub._ From whence comes this?

  _Free._ An ulcer, long time lurking, now is burst.

  _Sir Hub._ Good sir, the time and your designs are soft.

  _Bea._ Ay, dear sir, counsel him, advise him; 'twill relish well
  From your carving. Good my sweet, rest safe.

  _Free._ All's well! all's well!--this shall be ended straight.

  _Sir Hub._ The banquet stays;--there we'll discourse more large.

  _Free._ Marriage must not make men cowards.

  _Sir Lio._ Nor rage fools.                                       19

  _Sir Hub._ 'Tis valour not where heat but reason rules.

                    [_Exeunt; only_ TYSEFEW _and_ CRISPINELLA _stay_.

  _Tyse._ But do you hear, lady?--you proud ape, you!
  What was the jest you brake of me even now?

  _Cris._ Nothing. I only said you were all mettle;--that
  you had a brazen face, a leaden brain, and a copper
  beard.

  _Tyse._ Quicksilver,--thou little more than a dwarf,
  and something less than a woman.

  _Cris._ A wisp! a wisp! a wisp!--will you go to the
  banquet?

  _Tyse._ By the Lord, I think thou wilt marry shortly
  too; thou growest somewhat foolish already.                      31

  _Cris._ O, i'faith, 'tis a fair thing to be married, and a
  necessary. To hear this word _must_! If our husbands
  be proud, we must bear his contempt; if noisome, we
  must bear with the goat under his armholes; if a fool,
  we must bear his bable;[76] and, which is worse, if a
  loose liver, we must live upon unwholesome reversions;
  where, on the contrary side, our husbands--because
  they may, and we must--care not for us. Things
  hoped with fear, and got with strugglings, are men's high
  pleasures, when duty palls and flats their appetite.             41

  _Tyse._ What a tart monkey is this! By heaven! if
  thou hadst not so much wit, I could find in my heart
  to marry thee. Faith, bear with me for all this!

  _Cris._ Bear with thee? I wonder how thy mother
  could bear thee ten months in her belly, when I cannot
  endure thee two hours in mine eye.

  _Tyse._ Alas, for your sweet soul! By the Lord, you
  are grown a proud, scurvy, apish, idle, disdainful,
  scoffing--God's foot! because you have read _Euphues
  and his England_,[77] _Palmerin de Oliva_,[78] and the _Legend
  of Lies_![79]                                                    52

  _Cris._ Why, i'faith, yet, servant, you of all others
  should bear with my known unmalicious humours: I
  have always in my heart given you your due respect.
  And Heaven may be sworn, I have privately given fair
  speech of you, and protested----

  _Tyse._ Nay, look you; for my own part, if I have not
  as religiously vow'd my heart to you,--been drunk to
  your health, swallowed flap-dragons,[80] ate glasses, drunk
  urine,[81] stabb'd arms,[82] and done all the offices of protested
  gallantry for your sake; and yet you tell me I
  have a brazen face, a leaden brain, and a copper beard!
  Come, yet, and it please you.                                    64

  _Cris._ No, no;--you do not love me.

  _Tyse._ By ---- but I do now; and whosoever dares
  say that I do not love you, nay, honour you, and if you
  would vouchsafe to marry----

  _Cris._ Nay, as for that, think on't as you will, but
  God's my record,--and my sister knows I have taken
  drink and slept upon't,--that if ever I marry, it shall be
  you; and I will marry, and yet I hope I do not say it
  shall be you neither.                                            73

  _Tyse._ By Heaven, I shall be as soon weary of health
  as of your enjoying!--Will you cast a smooth cheek
  upon me?

  _Cris._ I cannot tell. I have no crump'd shoulders,
  my back needs no mantle, and yet marriage is honourable.
  Do you think ye shall prove a cuckold?

  _Tyse._ No, by the Lord, not I!                                  80

  _Cris._ Why, I thank you, i'faith. Heigho! I slept on
  my back this morning, and dreamt the strangest dreams.
  Good Lord! How things will come to pass! Will
  you go to the banquet?

  _Tyse._ If you will be mine, you shall be your own:--my
  purse, my body, my heart, is yours,--only be silent
  in my house, modest at my table, and wanton in my
  bed;--and the Empress of Europe cannot content, and
  shall not be contented, better.                                  89

  _Cris._ Can any kind heart speak more discreetly affectionately?
  My father's consent; and as for mine----

  _Tyse._ Then thus, and thus, so Hymen should begin;
  Sometimes a falling out proves falling in.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

     [82] It appears (from passages in Ben Jonson, Middleton, &c.)

                             SCENE II.

                _Near_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

      _Enter_ FREEVILL, _speaking to some within_; MALHEUREUX
                        _at the other door_.


  _Free._ As you respect my virtue, give me leave
  To satisfy my reason, though not blood.--
  So all runs right; our feign�d rage hath ta'en
  To fullest life: they are much possess'd
  Of force most, most all quarrel. Now, my right friend,
  Resolve me with open breast, free and true heart;
  Cannot thy virtue, having space to think
  And fortify her weakened powers with reason,
  Discourses, meditations, discipline,
  Divine ejaculatories, and all those aids against devils,--
  Cannot all these curb thy low appetite                           11
  And sensual fury?

  _Mal._ There is no God in blood, no reason in desire.
  Shall I but live? Shall I not be forced to act
  Some deed whose very name is hideous?

  _Free._ No.

  _Mal._ Then I must enjoy Franceschina.

  _Free._ You shall.
  I'll lend this ring: show it to that fair devil:
  It will resolve me dead;
  Which rumour, with my artificial absence,
  Will make most firm: enjoy her suddenly.                         20

  _Mal._ But if report go strong that you are slain,
  And that by me,--whereon I may be seized,--
  Where shall I find your being?

  _Free._ At Master Shatewe's the jeweller's, to whose breast
  I'll trust our secret purpose.

  _Mal._ Ay, rest yourself;
  Each man hath follies.

  _Free._ But those worst of all,
  Who, with a willing eye, do seeing fall.

  _Mal._ 'Tis true, but truth seems folly in madness'
  spectacles. I am not now myself, no man: farewell.

  _Free._ Farewell.                                                30

  _Mal._ When woman's in the heart, in the soul hell.

                                                  [_Exit_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Free._ Now, repentance, the fool's whip, seize thee;
  Nay, if there be no means I'll be thy friend,
  But not thy vices'; and with greatest sense
  I'll force thee feel thy errors to the worst;
  The wildest of dangers thou shalt sink into.
  No jeweller shall see me; I will lurk
  Where none shall know or think; close I'll withdraw,
  And leave thee with two friends--a whore and knave;
  But is this virtue in me? No, not pure,                          40
  Nothing extremely best with us endures;
  No use in simple purities; the elements
  Are mix'd for use; silver without allay[83]
  Is all too eager[84] to be wrought for use:
  Nor precise virtues, ever purely good,
  Holds useful size with temper of weak blood.
  Then let my course be borne, though with side-wind;
  The end being good, the means are well assign'd.

                                                             [_Exit._

                     _Franceschina's lodging._

           _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA _melancholy_, COCLEDEMOY
                           _leading her_.


  _Coc._ Come, catafugo, Frank o' Frank-hall! who, who
  ho! Excellent! Ha, here's a plump-rump'd wench,
  with a breast softer than a courtier's tongue, an old
  lady's gums, or an old man's _mentula_. My fine
  rogue----

  _Fra._ Pah, you poltroon!

  _Coc._ Goody fist,[85] flumpum pumpum; ah, my fine wag-tail,
  thou art as false, as prostituted, and adulterate as
  some translated manuscript. Buss, fair whore, buss!

  _Fra._ God's sacrament, pox!                                     10

  _Coc._ _Hadamoy key_, dost thou frown, _medianthon
  teukey_? Nay, look here._ Numeron key_, silver _blithefor
  cany, os cany_ goblet: _us key ne moy blegefoy oteeston pox_,
  on you gosling!

  _Fra._ By me fait, dis bin very fine langage; ick sall
  bush ye now; ha, be garzon, vare had you dat plate?

  _Coc._ _Hedemoy key_, get you gone, punk rampant, _key_,
  common up-tail!

                   _Enter_ MARY FAUGH _in haste_.

  _Mar._ O daughter, cousin, niece, servant, mistress!

  _Coc._ Humpum, plumpum squat, I am gone.                         20

                                                  [_Exit_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Mar._ There is one Master Malheureux at the door
  desires to see you. He says he must not be denied,
  for he hath sent this ring; and withal says 'tis done.

  _Fra._ Vat sall me do now, God's sacrament! Tell him
  two hours hence he sall be most affectionately velcome;
  tell him (vat sall me do?), tel him ick am bin in my bate,
  and ick sall perfume my feets, mak a mine body so delicate
  for his arm, two hours hence.

  _Mar._ I shall satisfy him: two hours hence, well.               29

                                                        [_Exit_ MARY.

  _Fra._ Now ick sall revange; hay, begar, me sal tartar
  de whole generation! Mine brain vork it. Freevill is
  dead, Malheureux sall hang; and mine rival, Beatrice,
  ick sall make run mad.

                        _Enter_ MARY FAUGH.

  _Mar._ He's gone, forsooth, to eat a caudle of cock-stones,
  and will return within this two hours.

  _Fra._ Verie vel, give monies to some fellow to squire
  me; ick sal go abroad.

  _Mar._ There's a lusty bravo beneath, a stranger, but a
  good stale[86] rascal. He swears valiantly, kicks a bawd
  right virtuously, and protests with an empty pocket right
  desperately. He'll squire you.                                   41

  _Fra._ Very velcom; mine fan; ick sall retorn presantly.
  Now sal me be revange; ten tousant devla! der sall be
  no got in me but passion, no tought but rage, no mercy
  but bloud, no spirit but divla in me. Dere sal noting
  tought good for me, but dat is mischievous for others.

                             SCENE IV.

               _Room in_ Sir HUBERT SUBBOYS' _house_.

       _Enter_ Sir HUBERT, Sir LIONEL, BEATRICE, CRISPINELLA,
                 _and_ Nurse, TYSEFEW _following_.


  _Sir Lio._ Did no one see him since?--pray God!--nay, all is well.
  A little heat; what? he is but withdrawn;
  And yet I would to God!--but fear you nothing.

  _Bea._ Pray God that all be well, or would I were not!

  _Tyse._ He's not to be found, sir, anywhere.

  _Sir Lio._ You must not make a heavy face presage an
  ill event. I like your sister well, she's quick and lively:
  would she would marry, faith.

  _Cri._ Marry, nay and I would marry, methinks an old
  man's a quiet thing.                                             10

  _Sir Lio._ Ha, mass! and so he is.

  _Cri._ You are a widower?

  _Sir Lio._ That I am, i'faith, fair Crisp; and I can tell
  you, would you affect me, I have it in me yet, i'faith.

  _Cri._ Troth I am in love; let me see your hand:
  would you cast yourself away upon me willingly?

  _Sir Lio._ Will I? Ay, by the----

  _Cri._ Would you be a cuckold willingly? By my
  troth 'tis a comely, fine, and handsome sight, for one of
  my years to marry an old man; truth, 'tis restorative;
  what a comfortable thing it is to think of her husband,
  to hear his venerable cough o' the everlastings, to feel
  his rough skin, his summer hands and winter legs, his
  almost no eyes, and assuredly no teeth; and then to
  think what she must dream of, when she considers
  others' happiness and her own want! 'tis a worthy and
  notorious comfortable match.                                     27

  _Sir Lio._ Pish, pish! will you have me?

  _Cri._ Will you assure me----

  _Sir Lio._ Five hundred pound jointure?

  _Cri._ That you will die within this fortnight?

  _Sir Lio._ No, by my faith, Cris.

  _Cri._ Then Crisp by her faith assures you she'll have
  none of you.

       _Enter_ Young FREEVILL _disguised like a pander, and_
                           FRANCESCHINA.

  _Free._ By'r leave, gentles and men of nightcaps, I would
  speak, but that here stands one is able to express her
  own tale best.

  _Fra._ Sir, mine speech is to you; you had a son,
  matre Freevill?

  _Sir Lio._ Had, ha! and have.                                    40

  _Fra._ No point,[87] me am come to assure you dat one
  mestre Malheureux hath killed him.

  _Bea._ O me! wretched, wretched!

  _Sir Hub._ Look to our daughter.

  _Sir Lio._ How art thou inform'd?

  _Fra._ If dat it please you to go vid me, ick sall bring
  you where you sall hear Malheureux vid his own lips
  confess it, and dare ye may apprehend him, and revenge
  your and mine love's blood.

  _Sir Hub._ Your love's blood! mistress, was he your
  love?                                                            51

  _Fra._ He was so, sir; let your daughter hear it: do
  not veep, lady; de young man dat be slain did not love
  you, for he still lovit me ten tousant tousant times more
  dearly.

  _Bea._ O my heart, I will love you the better; I cannot
  hate what he affected. O passion, O my grief! which
  way wilt break, think, and consume!

  _Cri._ Peace!

  _Bea._ Dear woes cannot speak.                                   60

  _Fra._ For look you, lady, dis your ring he gave me,
  vid most bitter jests at your scorn'd kindness.

  _Bea._ He did not ill not to love me, but sure he did
  not well to mock me: gentle minds will pity, though
  they cannot love; yet peace and my love sleep with him.
  Unlace, good nurse; alas! I was not so ambitious of so
  supreme an happiness, that he should only love me;
  'twas joy enough for me, poor soul, that I only might
  only love him.

  _Fra._ O but to be abused, scorn'd, scoff'd at! O ten
  tousand divla, by such a one, and unto such a one!               71

  _Bea._ I think you say not true, sister; shall we know
  one another in the other world?

  _Cri._ What means my sister?

  _Bea._ I would fain see him again! O my tortured mind!
  Freevill is more than dead, he is unkind!

                        [_Exeunt_ BEATRICE, CRISPINELLA, _and_ Nurse.

  _Sir Hub._ Convey her in, and so, sir, as you said,
  Set a strong watch.

  _Sir Lio._ Ay, sir, and so pass along with this same common
  woman; you must make it good.                                    80

  _Fra._ Ick sall, or let me pay for his mine bloud.

  _Sir Hub._ Come, then, along all, with quiet speed.

  _Sir Lio._ O fate!

  _Tyse._ O sir, be wisely sorry, but not passionate.

                                    [_Exeunt all but_ Young FREEVILL.

  _Free._ I will go and reveal myself! stay, no, no;
  Grief endears love. Heaven! to have such a wife
  Is happiness to breed pale envy in the saints.
  Thou worthy dove-like virgin without gall,
  Cannot (that woman's evil) jealousy,
  Despite disgrace, nay, which is worse, contempt,                 90
  Once stir thy faith? O truth, how few sisters hast thou!
  Dear memory!
  With what a suffering sweetness, quiet modesty,
  Yet deep affection, she received my death!
  And then with what a patient, yet oppressed kindness,
  She took my lewdly intimated wrongs!
  O the dearest of heaven! were there but three
  Such women in the world, two might be saved.
  Well, I am great
  With expectation to what devilish end                           100
  This woman of foul soul will drive her plots;
  But Providence all wicked art o'ertops;
  And impudence must know (tho' stiff as ice),
  That fortune doth not always dote on vice.

                                                             [_Exit._

                              SCENE V.

                            _A Street._

       _Enter_ Sir HUBERT, Sir LIONEL, TYSEFEW, FRANCESCHINA,
                     _and three with halberds_.


  _Sir Hub._ Plant a watch there! be very careful, sirs;
  the rest with us.

  _Tyse._ The heavy night grows to her depth of quiet;
  'Tis about mid-darkness.

  _Fra._ Mine shambre is hard by; ick sall bring you to
  it presantment.

  _Sir Lio._ Deep silence! On!

                                                           [_Exeunt._

  _Coc._ (_within_). Wa, ha, ho!

                         _Enter_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Mul._ It was his voice, 'tis he: he sups with his
  cupping-glasses. 'Tis late; he must pass this way: I'll
  ha' him--I'll ha' my fine boy, my worshipful Cocledemoy;
  I'll moy him; he shall be hang'd in lousy
  linen; I'll hire some sectary to make him an heretic
  before he die; and when he is dead I'll piss on his
  grave.                                                           15

                        _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _Coc._ Ah, my fine punks, good night, Frank Frailty,
  Frail o' Frail-hall! _Bonus noches, my ubiquitari._

  _Mul._ Ware polling and shaving, sir.

  _Coc._ A wolf, a wolf, a wolf!

                  [_Exit_ COCLEDEMOY, _leaving his cloak behind him_.

  _Mul._ Here's something yet, a cloak, a cloak! Yet
  I'll after; he cannot 'scape the watch; I'll hang him if
  I have any mercy. I'll slice him.

                                                             [_Exit._

          _Enter three_ Constables; _to them_ COCLEDEMOY.

  _1st Con._ Who goes there? Come before the constable.            24

  _Coc._ Bread o' God! constable, you are a watch for
  the devil. Honest men are robb'd under your nose;
  there's a false knave in the habit of a vintner set upon
  me; he would have had my purse, but I took me to my
  heels: yet he got my cloak, a plain stuff cloak, poor,
  yet 'twill serve to hang him. 'Tis my loss, poor man
  that I am!                                                       31

                                                             [_Exit._

       _Enter_ MULLIGRUB _running with_ COCLEDEMOY'S _cloak_.

  _2d Con._ Masters, we must watch better; is't not
  strange that knaves, drunkards, and thieves should be
  abroad, and yet we of the watch, scriveners, smiths, and
  tailors, never stir?

  _1st Con._ Hark, who goes there?

  _Mul._ An honest man and a citizen.

  _2d Con._ Appear, appear; what are you?

  _Mul._ A simple vintner.

  _1st Con._ A vintner ha! and simple; draw nearer,
  nearer; here's the cloak.                                        41

  _2d Con._ Ay, Master Vintner, we know you: a plain
  stuff cloak; 'tis it.

  _1st Con._ Right, come! O thou varlet, dost not thou
  know that the wicked cannot 'scape the eyes of the
  constable?

  _Mul._ What means this violence? As I am an honest
  man I took the cloak----

  _1st Con._ As you are a knave, you took the cloak, we
  are your witnesses for that.                                     50

  _Mul._ But, hear me, hear me! I'll tell you what I am.

  _2d Con._ A thief you are.

  _Mul._ I tell you my name is Mulligrub.

  _1st Con._ I will grub you. In with him to the stocks;
  there let him sit till to-morrow morning, that Justice
  Quodlibet may examine him.

  _Mul._ Why, but I tell thee----

  _2d Con._ Why, but I tell thee, we'll tell thee now.

  _Mul._ Am I not mad? am I not an ass? Why, scabs,
  God's-foot! let me out.                                          60

  _2d Con._ Ay, ay, let him prate; he shall find matter
  in us scabs, I warrant: God's-so, what good members
  of the commonwealth do we prove!

  _1st Con._ Prithee, peace; let's remember our duties,
  and let's[88] go sleep, in the fear of God.

                    [_Exeunt, having left_ MULLIGRUB _in the stocks_.

  _Mul._ Who goes there? Illo, ho, ho: zounds, shall I
  run mad--lose my wits! Shall I be hang'd? Hark;
  who goes there? Do not fear to be poor, Mulligrub;
  thou hast a sure stock now.

              _Re-enter_ COCLEDEMOY _like a bellman_.

  _Coc._ The night grows old,                                      70
  And many a cuckold
  Is now--Wha, ha, ha, ho!
  Maids on their backs
  Dream of sweet smacks,
  And warm--Wo, ho, ho, ho!
  I must go comfort my venerable Mulligrub, I must
  fiddle him till he fist.[89] Fough!
  Maids in your night-rails,
  Look well to your light--
  Keep close your locks,                                           80
  And down your smocks;
  Keep a broad eye,
  And a close thigh.
  Excellent, excellent! Who's there? Now, Lord, Lord--Master
  Mulligrub--deliver us! what does your worship
  in the stocks? I pray come out, sir.

  _Mul._ Zounds, man, I tell thee I am lock'd!

  _Coc._ Lock'd! O world! O men! O time! O night!
  that canst not discern virtue and wisdom, and one of
  the common council! What is your worship in for?                 90

  _Mul._ For (a plague on't) suspicion of felony.

  _Coc._ Nay, and it be such a trifle, Lord, I could weep,
  to see your good worship in this taking. Your worship
  has been a good friend to me, and tho' you have forgot
  me, yet I knew your wife before she was married, and
  since I have found your worship's door open, and I
  have knock'd, and God knows what I have saved: and
  do I live to see your worship stocked?

  _Mul._ Honest bellman, I perceive
  Thou knowest me: I prithee call the watch.                      100
  Inform the constable of my reputation,
  That I may no longer abide in this shameful habitation,
  And hold thee all I have about me.

                                              [_Gives him his purse._

  _Coc._ 'Tis more than I deserve, sir: let me alone for
  your delivery.

  _Mul._ Do, and then let me alone with Cocledemoy.
  I'll moy him!

                     _Re-enter the_ Constables.

  _Coc._ Maids in your----
  Master Constable, whose that ith' stocks?

  _1st Con._ One for a robbery: one Mulligrub, he calls
  himself. Mulligrub? Bellman, knowest thou him?                  111

  _Coc._ Know him! O, Master Constable, what good
  service have you done! Know him? He's a strong
  thief; his house has been suspected for a bawdy tavern
  a great while, and a receipt for cut-purses, 'tis most
  certain. He has been long in the black book, and is he
  ta'en now?

  _2d Con._ By'r lady, my masters, we'll not trust the
  stocks with him, we'll have him to the justices, get a
  _mittimus_ to Newgate presently. Come, sir, come on,
  sir.                                                            121

  _Mul._ Ha! does your rascalship yet know my worship
  in the end?

  _1st Con._ Ay, the end of your worship we know.

  _Mul._ Ha! goodman constable, here's an honest fellow
  can tell you what I am?

  _2d Con._ 'Tis true, sir; y'are a strong thief, he says,
  on his own knowledge. Bind fast, bind fast! we know
  you. We'll trust no stocks with you. Away with him
  to the jail instantly.                                          130

  _Mul._ Why, but dost hear? Bellman, rogue, rascal!
  God's--why, but--

                               [_The Constables drag away_ MULLIGRUB.

  _Coc._ Why, but! wha, ha, ha! excellent, excellent!
  ha, my fine Cocledemoy, my vintner fists. I'll make
  him fart crackers before I ha' done with him; to-morrow
  is the day of judgment. Afore the Lord God, my
  knavery grows unperegall;[90] 'tis time to take a nap, until
  half an hour hence. God give your worship music,
  content, and rest.

                                                             [_Exit._

                              SCENE I.

                     _Franceschina's lodging._

         _Enter_ FRANCESCHINA, Sir _LIONEL_, TYSEFEW, _with
                             Officers_.


  _Fra._ You bin very velcom to mine shambra.

  _Sir Lio._ But, how know ye, how are ye assured,
  Both of the deed, and of his sure return?

  _Fra._ O min-here, ick sall tell you. Metre Malheureux
  came all bretless running a my shambra, his sword all
  bloudy: he tel a me he had kil Freevill, and pred a me
  to conceal him. Ick flatter him, bid bring monies, he
  should live and lie vid me. He went, whilst ick (me
  hope vidout sins), out of mine mush love to Freevill,
  betray him.                                                      10

  _Sir Lio._ Fear not, 'tis well: good works get grace for
  sin.

                             [_She conceals them behind the curtain._

  _Fra._ Dere, peace, rest dere; so, softly, all go in.--
  De net is lay, now sal ick be revenge.
  If dat me knew a dog dat Freevill love,
  Me would puisson him; for know de deepest hell
  As a revenging woman's naught so fell.

                        _Enter_ MARY FAUGH.

  _Mar._ Ho! Cousin Frank, the party you wot of,
  Master Malheureux--

  _Fra._ Bid him come up, I prede.

                                    [_Cantat saltatque cum cithara._

                        _Enter_ MALHEUREUX.

  _Fra._ O min-here man, a dere liver love,                        20
  Mine ten tousant times velcom love!
  Ha! by mine trat, you bin de just--vat sall me say?
  Vat seet honie name sall I call you?

  _Mal._ Any from you
  Is pleasure. Come, my loving prettiness,
  Where's thy chamber? I long to touch your sheets.

  _Fra._ No, no, not yet, mine seetest soft-lipp'd love,
  You sall not gulp down all delights at once.
  Be min trat, dis all-fles-lovers, dis ravenous wenchers[91]
  dat sallow all down hole, vill have all at one bit; fie, fie,
  fie! be min fait, dey do eat comfets vid spoons.                 31
  No, no, I'll make you chew your pleasure vit love;
  De more degrees and steps, de more delight,
  De more endear�d is de pleasure height.

  _Mal._ What, you're a learn'd wanton, and proceed by art?

  _Fra._ Go, little vag, pleasure should have a crane's long
  neck, to relish de ambrosia of delight. And ick pre de
  tell me, for me loves to hear of manhood very mush,
  i'fait: ick prede--vat vas me a saying? Oh, ick prede
  tell a me how did you killa Metre Freevill?                      40

  _Mal._ Why, quarrelled o' set purpose, drew him out,
  Singled him, and, having the advantage
  Of my sword and might, ran him through and through.

  _Fra._ Vat did you vid him van he was sticken?

  _Mal._ I dragg'd him by the heels to the next wharf,
  And spurn'd him in the river.

                       [_Those in ambush rusheth forth and take him._

  _Sir Lio._ Seize, seize him!
  O monstrous! O ruthless villain!

  _Mal._ What mean you, gentlemen? By heaven----

  _Tyse._ Speak not of anything that's good.                       49

  _Mal._ Your errors gives you passion: Freevill lives.

  _Sir Lio._ Thy own lips say thou liest.

  _Mal._ Let me die, if at Shatewe's the jeweller he lives
  not safe untouch'd.

  _Tyse._ Meantime to strictest guard, to sharpest prison.

  _Mal._ No rudeness, gentlemen: I'll go undragg'd.
  O, wicked, wicked devil!

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Sir Lio._ Sir, the day of trial is this morn; let's prosecute
  The sharpest rigour and severest end:
  Good men are cruel when they're vice's friend.

  _Sir Hub._ Woman, we thank thee with no empty hand;
  Strumpets are fit[92] for something. Farewell.                   61

                                 [_All save_ Young FREEVILL _depart_.

  _Free._ Ay, for hell!
  O, thou unreprievable, beyond all
  Measure of grace damn'd irremediably![93]
  That things of beauty created for sweet use,
  Soft comfort, as[94] the very music of life,
  Custom should make so unutterably[95] hellish!
  O, heaven!
  What difference is in women and their life!
  What man, but worthy name of man, would leave                    70
  The modest pleasures of a lawful bed--
  The holy union of two equal hearts
  Mutually holding either dear as health--
  Th' undoubted issues, joys of chaste sheets,
  Th' unfeign'd embrace of sober ignorance--
  To twine th' unhealthful loins of common loves,
  The prostituted impudence of things,
  Senseless like those by cataracts of Nile,
  Their use so vile takes away sense! How vile
  To love a creature made of blood and hell,                       80
  Whose use makes weak, whose company doth shame,
  Whose bed doth beggar, issue doth defame!

                      _Re-enter_ FRANCESCHINA.

  _Fra._ Metre Freevill live? ha, ha, live at Mestre
  Shatewe's! Mush[96] at Metre Shatewe's! Freevill is dead,
  Malheureux sall hang: and, sweet divel, dat Beatrice
  would but run mad, dat she would but run mad! den me
  would dance and sing. Metre Don Dubon, me pre ye
  now go to Mestres Beatrice. Tell her Freevill is sure
  dead, and dat he curse herself especially, for dat he was
  sticked in her quarrel, swearing in his last gasp, dat if it
  had bin in mine quarrels 'twould never have grieved him.

  _Free._ I will.                                                  92

  _Fra._ Prede do, and say any ting dat vil vex her.

  _Free._ Let me alone to vex her.

  _Fra._ Vil you, vil you mak a her run mad? Here,
  take dis ring, see me scorn to wear anyting dat was hers
  or his. I prede torment her, ick cannot love her; she
  honest and virtuous, forsooth!

  _Free._ Is she so? O vile creature! then let me alone
  with her.                                                       100

  _Fra._ Vat, vil you mak a her mad? seet, by min trat,
  be pretta servan; bush,[97] ick sall go to bet now.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Free._ Mischief, whither wilt thou? O thou tearless woman!
  How monstrous is thy devil,
  The end of hell as thee!
  How miserable were it to be virtuous,
  If thou couldst prosper!
  I'll to my love, the faithful Beatrice;
  She has wept enough, and faith, dear soul, too much.
  But yet how sweet is it to think how dear                       110
  One's life was to his love: how mourn'd his death!
  'Tis joy not to be express'd with breath:
  But O let him that would such passion drink,
  Be quiet of his speech, and only think!

                                                             [_Exit._

                             SCENE II.

                       BEATRICE'S _chamber_.

                _Enter_ BEATRICE _and_ CRISPINELLA.


  _Bea._ Sister, cannot a woman kill herself? is it not
  lawful to die when we should not live?

  _Cri._ O sister, 'tis a question not for us; we must do
  what God will.

  _Bea._ What God will? Alas, can torment be His
  glory, or our grief His pleasure! Does not the nurse's
  nipple, juiced over with wormwood, bid the child it
  should not suck? And does not Heaven, when it hath
  made our breath bitter unto us, say we should not live?
  O my best sister,                                                10
  To suffer wounds when one may 'scape this rod
  Is against nature, that is against God!

  _Cri._ Good sister,
  Do not make me weep; sure Freevill was not false.
  I'll gage my life that strumpet, out of craft
  And some close second end, hath maliced[98] him.

  _Bea._ O sister! if he were not false, whom have I lost?
  If he were, what grief to such unkindness!
  From head to foot I am all misery;
  Only in this, some justice I have found--                        20
  My grief is like my love, beyond all bound.

                           _Enter_ NURSE.

  _Nur._ My servant, Master Caqueteur, desires to visit
  you.

  _Cri._ For grief's sake keep him out; his discourse is
  like the long word _Honorificabilitudinitatibus_,[99] a great
  deal of sound and no sense: his company is like a
  parenthesis to a discourse,--you may admit it, or leave
  it out, it makes no matter.

                _Enter_ FREEVILL _in his disguise_.

  _Free._ By your leave, sweet creatures.

  _Cri._ Sir, all I can yet say of you is, you are uncivil.

  _Free._ You must deny it. By your sorrow's leave,                31
  I bring some music to make sweet your grief.

  _Bea._ Whate'er you please. O break my heart!
  Canst thou yet pant? O dost thou yet survive?
  Thou didst not love him if thou now canst live!

                       FREEVILL _sings_.[100]

                 _O Love, how strangely sweet
                    Are thy weak passions!
                  That love and joy should meet
                    In self-same fashions!
                  O who can tell                                   40
                    The cause why this should move?
                  But only this,--
                    No reason ask of Love!_

                                            [BEATRICE _swounds_.[101]

  _Cri._ Hold, peace!--the gentlest soul is sownd. O
  my best sister!

  _Free._ Ha, get you gone, close the doors! My Beatrice!

                                                [_Discovers himself._

  Cursed be my indiscreet trials! O my immeasurably
  loving--

  _Cri._ She stirs, give air, she breathes!

  _Bea._ Where am I? Ha! how have I slipp'd off life?
  Am I in heaven? O my lord, though not loving,                    51
  By our eternal being, yet give me leave
  To rest by thy dear[102] side! Am I not in heaven?

  _Free._ O eternally much loved,[103] recollect your spirits!

  _Bea._ Ha, you do speak! I do see you, I do live!
  I would not die now: let me not burst with wonder.

  _Free._ Call up your blood; I live to honour you
  As the admired glory of your sex.
  Nor ever hath my love been false to you;
  Only I presum'd to try your faith too much,                      60
  For which I most am grieved.

  _Cri._ Brother, I must be plain with you, you have
  wrong'd us.

  _Free._ I am not so covetous to deny it;
  But yet, when my discourse hath stay'd your quaking,
  You will be smoother lipp'd; and the delight
  And satisfaction which we all have got,
  Under these strange disguisings, when you know,
  You will be mild and quiet, forget at last:
  It is much joy to think on sorrows past.

  _Bea._ Do you then live? and are you not untrue?                 70
  Let me not die with joy; pleasure's more extreme
  Than grief; there's nothing sweet to man but mean.

  _Free._ Heaven cannot be too gracious to such goodness.
  I shall discourse to you the several chances;
  But hark, I must yet rest disguis'd;
  The sudden close of many drifts now meet:
  Where pleasure hath some profit, art is sweet.

                          _Enter_ TYSEFEW.

  _Tyse._ News, news, news, news!

  _Cri._ Oysters, oysters, oysters, oysters!                       79

  _Tyse._ Why, is not this well now? Is not this better
  than louring and pouting and puling, which is hateful to
  the living and vain to the dead? Come, come, you must
  live by the quick, when all is done; and for my own part,
  let my wife laugh at me when I am dead, so she'll smile
  upon me whilst I live: but to see a woman whine, and
  yet keep her eyes dry: mourn, and yet keep her cheeks
  fat: nay, to see a woman claw her husband by the feet
  when he is dead, that would have scratched him by
  the face when he was living--this now is somewhat
  ridiculous.                                                      90

  _Cri._ Lord, how you prate.

  _Tyse._ And yet I was afraid, i'faith, that I should ha'
  seen a garland on this beauty's hearse; but time, truth,
  experience, and variety, are great doers with women.

  _Cri._ But what's the news?--the news, I pray you?

  _Tyse._ I pray you? ne'er pray me: for by your leave
  you may command me. This 'tis:
  The public sessions, which this day is past,
  Hath doom'd to death ill-fortuned Malheureux.

  _Cri._ But, sir, we heard he offer'd to make good,              100
  That Freevill lived at Shatewe's the jeweller's----

  _Bea._ And that 'twas but a plot betwixt them two.

  _Tyse._ O, ay, ay, he gaged his life with it; but know,
  When all approach'd the test, Shatewe[104] denied
  He saw or heard of any such complot,
  Or of Freevill; so that his own defence
  Appeared so false, that, like a madman's sword,
  He stroke his own heart; he hath the course of law,
  And instantly must suffer. But the jest
  (If hanging be a jest, as many make it)                         110
  Is to take notice of one Mulligrub,
  A sharking vintner.

  _Free._ What of him, sir?

  _Tyse._ Nothing but hanging: the whoreson slave is mad
  before he hath lost his senses.

  _Free._ Was his fact[105] clear and made apparent, sir?

  _Tyse._ No, faith, suspicious; for 'twas thus protested:
  A cloak was stol'n; that cloak he had; he had it,
  Himself confess'd, by force; the rest of his defence
  The choler of a justice wronged in wine,                        120
  Join'd with malignance of some hasty jurors,
  Whose wit was lighted by the justice' nose;
  The knave was cast.
  But, Lord, to hear his moan, his prayers, his wishes,
  His zeal ill-tim�d, and his words unpitied,
  Would make a dead man rise and smile,
  Whilst he observed how fear can make men vile.

  _Cri._ Shall we go meet the execution?

  _Bea._ I shall be ruled by you.

  _Tyse._ By my troth, a rare motion;[106] you must haste,
  For malefactors goes like the world, upon wheels.               130

  _Bea._ Will you man us? You shall be our guide.

                                                 [_To_[107] FREEVILL.

  _Free._ I am your servant.

  _Tyse._ Ha, servant? Zounds, I am no companion for
  panders! you're best make him your love.

  _Bea._ So will I, sir; we must live by the quick, you say.

  _Tyse._ 'Sdeath o' virtue! what a damn'd thing's this!
  Who'll trust fair faces, tears, and vows? 'Sdeath! not I.
  She is a woman,--that is,--she can lie.

  _Cri._ Come, come, turn not a man of time,[108] to make all ill
  Whose goodness you conceive not, since the worst of chance      140
  Is to crave grace for heedless ignorance.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                             SCENE III.

                         _A Public Place._

               _Enter_ COCLEDEMOY, _like a sergeant_.


  _Coc._ So, I ha' lost my sergeant in an ecliptic mist,
  drunk! horrible drunk! he is fine. So now will I fit
  myself; I hope this habit will do me no harm; I am an
  honest man already. Fit, fit, fit, as a punk's tail, that
  serves everybody. By this time my vintner thinks of
  nothing but hell and sulphur; he farts fire and brimstone
  already. Hang toasts! the execution approacheth.

  _Enter_ Sir LIONEL, Sir HUBERT; MALHEUREUX, _pinioned_;
     TYSEFEW, BEATRICE, FREEVILL, CRISPINELLA, FRANCESCHINA,
     _and halberds_.

  _Mal._ I do not blush, although condemned by laws;
  No kind of death is shameful but the cause,
  Which I do know is none; and yet my lust                         10
  Hath made the one (although not cause) most just.
  May I not be reprieved? Freevill is but mislodg'd;
  Some lethargy hath seiz'd him--no, much malice;
  Do not lay blood upon your souls with good intents;
  Men may do ill, and law sometime repents.

                              [COCLEDEMOY _picks_ MALHEUREUX' _pocket
                                 of his purse_.

  _Sir Lio._ Sir, sir, prepare; vain is all lewd defence.

  _Mal._ Conscience was law, but now law's conscience.
  My endless peace is made; and to the poor,--
  My purse, my purse!

  _Coc._ Ay, sir; and it shall please you, the poor has
  your purse already.                                              21

  _Mal._ You[109] are a wily[110] man.
  --But now, thou source of devils, oh, how I loathe
  The very memory of that I adored!
  He that's of fair blood, well mien'd, of good breeding,
  Best famed, of sweet acquaintance, and true friends,
  And would with desperate impudence lose all these,
  And hazard landing at this fatal shore,--
  Let him ne'er kill, nor steal, but love a whore.

  _Fra._ De man does rave; tinck a got, tinck a got, and
  bid de flesh, de world, and the dible, farewell.                 31

  _Mal._ Farewell!

  _Free._ Farewell!

                                       [FREEVILL _discovers himself_.

  _Fra._ Vat ist you see?--Hah!

  _Free._ Sir, your pardon, with my this defence:
  Do not forget protested violence
  Of your low affections: no requests,
  No arguments of reason, no known danger,
  No assured wicked bloodiness,
  Could draw your heart from this damnation.                       40

  _Mal._ Why, stay!

  _Fra._ Unprosperous devil, vat sall me do now?

  _Free._ Therefore, to force you from the truer danger,
  I wrought the feign�d; suffering this fair devil
  In shape of woman to make good her plot:
  And, knowing that the hook was deeply fast,
  I gave her line at will, till, with her own vain strivings,
  See here she's tired. O thou comely damnation!
  Dost think that vice is not to be withstood?
  O what is woman, merely made of blood!                           50

  _Sir Lio._ You maze us all; let us not be lost in darkness!

  _Free._ All shall be lighted; but this time and place
  Forbids longer speech; only what you can think
  Has been extremely ill, is only hers.

  _Sir Lio._ To severest prison with her! With what heart canst live--
  What eyes behold a face?

  _Fra._ Ick vil not speak; torture, torture your fill,
  For me am worse than hang'd; me ha' lost my will.

                               [_Exit_ FRANCESCHINA _with the guard_.

  _Sir Lio._ To the extremest whip and jail.

  _Free._ Frolic, how is it, sirs?                                 60

  _Mal._ I am myself. How long was't ere I could
  Persuade my passion to grow calm to you!
  Rich sense makes good bad language, and a friend
  Should weigh no action, but the action's end.
  I am now worthy yours; when before
  The beast of man, loose blood, distemper'd us:
  He that lust rules cannot be virtuous.

       _Enter_ MULLIGRUB, Mistress MULLIGRUB, _and Officers_.

  _Off._ On afore there! room for the prisoners!

  _Mul._ I pray you do not lead me to execution through
  Cheapside. I owe Master Burnish, the goldsmith,
  money, and I fear he'll set a sergeant on my back for it.

  _Coc._ Trouble not your sconce, my Christian brothers,
  but have an eye unto the main chance. I will warrant
  your shoulders; as for your neck, _Plinius Secundus_, or
  _Marcus Tullius Cicero_, or somebody it is, says that a
  threefold cord is hardly broken.                                 75

  _Mul._ Well, I am not the first honest man that hath
  been cast away; and I hope shall not be the last.

  _Coc._ O, sir, have a good stomach and maws; you shall
  have a joyful supper.

  _Mul._ In troth I have no stomach to it; and it please
  you, take my trencher; I use to fast at nights.                  81

  _Mistress Mul._ O husband! I little thought you should
  have come to think on God thus soon;[111] nay, and you
  had been hang'd deservedly it would never have grieved
  me; I have known of many honest innocent men have
  been hang'd deservedly: but to be cast away for nothing!

  _Coc._ Good woman, hold your peace, your prittles and
  your prattles, your bibbles and your babbles; for I pray
  you hear me in private: I am a widower, and you are
  almost a widow; shall I be welcome to your houses, to
  your tables, and your other things?                              92

  _Mistress Mul._ I have a piece of mutton and a featherbed
  for you at all times; I pray make haste.

  _Mul._ I do here make my confession: if I owe any
  man anything, I do heartily forgive him; if any man
  owe me anything, let him pay my wife.

  _Coc._ I will look to your wife's payment, I warrant
  you.

  _Mul._ And now, good yoke-fellow, leave thy poor
  Mulligrub.                                                      101

  _Mistress Mul._ Nay, then I were unkind; i'faith I will
  not leave you until I have seen you hang.

  _Coc._ But brother,[112] brother, you must think of your
  sins and iniquities; you have been a broacher of profane
  vessels; you have made us drink of the juice of the whore
  of Babylon: for whereas good ale, perrys, bragots,[113]
  cyders, and metheglins, was the true ancient British and
  Troyan drinks, you ha' brought in Popish wines, Spanish
  wines, French wines, _tam Marti quam Mercurio_, both muscadine
  and malmsey, to the subversion, staggering, and
  sometimes overthrow of many a good Christian. You
  ha' been a great jumbler; O remember the sins of your
  nights! for your night works ha' been unsavoury in the
  taste of your customers.                                        115

  _Mul._ I confess, I confess; and I forgive as I would
  be forgiven. Do you know one Cocledemoy?

  _Coc._ O very well. Know him!--an honest man he is,
  and a comely; an upright dealer with his neighbours,
  and their wives speak good things of him.                       120

  _Mul._ Well, wheresoe'er he is, or whatsoe'er he is, I'll
  take it on my death he's the cause of my hanging. I
  heartily forgive him, and if he would come forth he
  might save me; for he only knows the why and the
  wherefore.

  _Coc._ You do, from your hearts and midrifs and entrails,
  forgive him then? you will not let him rot in rusty irons,
  procure him to be hang'd in lousy linen without a song,
  and after he is dead piss on his grave?

  _Mul._ That hard heart of mine has procured all this;
  but I forgive as I would be forgiven.                           131

  _Coc._ [_Discovering himself_] Hang toasts, my worshipful
  Mulligrub. Behold thy Cocledemoy, my fine vintner;
  my castrophomical fine boy; behold and see!

  _Tyse._ Bliss o' the blessed, who would but look for
  two knaves here?

  _Coc._ No knave, worshipful friend, no knave; for observe,
  honest Cocledemoy restores whatsoever he has
  got, to make you know that whatsoever he has done,
  has been only _euphoni� gratia_--for wit's sake. I
  acquit this vintner, as he has acquitted me; all has
  been done for emphasis of wit, my fine boy, my worshipful
  friends.

  _Tyse._ Go, you are a flatt'ring knave.                         143

  _Coc._ I am so; 'tis a good thriving trade; it comes
  forward better than the seven liberal sciences, or the
  nine cardinal virtues; which may well appear in this,
  you shall never have flattering knave turn courtier.
  And yet I have read of many courtiers that have turned
  flattering knaves.

  _Sir Hub._ Was't even but so? why, then all's well.             150

  _Mul._ I could even weep for joy.

  _Mistress Mul._ I could weep too, but God knows for
  what!

  _Tyse._ Here's another tack to be given--your son and
  daughter.

  _Sir Hub._ Is't possible? heart, ay, all my heart; will
  you be joined here?

  _Tyse._ Yes, faith, father; marriage and hanging are
  spun both in one hour.

  _Coc._ Why, then, my worshipful good friends, I bid
  myself most heartily welcome to your merry nuptials
  and wanton jigga-joggies.--And now, my very fine
  Heliconian gallants, and you, my worshipful friends in
  the middle region,                                              164
  If with content our hurtless mirth hath been,
  Let your pleased minds at our much care be seen;[114]
  For he shall find, that slights such trivial wit,
  'Tis easier to reprove than better it.
  We scorn to fear, and yet we fear to swell;
  We do not hope 'tis best,--'tis all, if well.                   170

  _Enter at one door the_ PROLOGUE, _two Pages with torches_,
     ASDRUBAL _and_ JUGURTH, _two Pages with lights_, MASSINISSA
     _leading_ SOPHONISBA, ZANTHIA _bearing_ SOPHONISBA'S _train_,
     ARCATHIA _and_ NYCEA, HANNO _and_ BYTHEAS: _at the other door two
     Pages with targets and javelins, two Pages with lights_, SYPHAX
     _arm'd from top to toe, followed by_ VANGUE.

  _These, thus enter'd, stand still, whilst the_ PROLOGUE,
     _resting between both troops, speaks_.


  The scene is Libya, and the subject thus:
  Whilst Carthage stood the only awe of Rome,
  As most imperial seat of Libya,
  Govern'd by statesmen, each as great as kings
  (For seventeen kings were Carthage feodars);
  Whilst thus she flourish'd, whilst her Hannibal
  Made Rome to tremble, and the walls yet pale:
  Then in this Carthage Sophonisba lived,
  The far-famed daughter of great Asdrubal:
  For whom ('mongst others) potent Syphax sues,                    10
  And well-graced Massinissa rivals him,
  Both princes of proud sceptres: but the lot
  Of doubtful favour Massinissa graced,
  At which Syphax grows black: for now the night
  Yields loud resoundings of the nuptial pomp:
  Apollo strikes his harp, Hymen his torch;
  Whilst louring Juno, with ill-boding eye,
  Sits envious at too forward Venus. Lo,
  The instant night: and now ye worthier minds,
  To whom we shall present a female glory                          20
  (The wonder of a constancy so fix'd,
  That fate itself might well grow envious):
  Be pleased to sit,[296] such as may merit oil,
  And holy dew, still'd from diviner heat.
  For rest thus knowing: what of this you hear,
  The author lowly hopes, but must not fear:
  For just worth never rests on popular frown,
  To have done well is fair deeds' only crown.

                                 OF
                            SOPHONISBA.




                               ACT I.


                              SCENE I.

                  _The palace of Syphax at Cirta._

                        SYPHAX _and_ VANGUE.


  _Sy._ Syphax, Syphax! why wast thou cursed a king?
  What angry god made thee so great, so vile?
  Contemn'd, disgrac�d! think, wert thou a slave,
  Though Sophonisba did reject thy love,
  Thy low neglected head, unpointed at,
  Thy shame unrumour'd, and thy suit unscoff'd,
  Might yet rest quiet. Reputation,
  Thou awe of fools and great men; thou that chok'st
  Freest addictions, and makest mortals sweat
  Blood and cold drops in fear to lose, or hope                    10
  To gain, thy never-certain seldom-worthy gracings;
  Reputation,
  Were't not for thee, Syphax could bear this scorn,
  Not spouting up his gall among his blood
  In black vexations: Massinissa might
  Enjoy the sweets of his preferr�d graces
  Without my dangerous envy or revenge;
  Were't not for thy affliction, all might sleep
  In sweet oblivion: but (O greatness' scourge!)
  We cannot without envy keep high name,                           20
  Nor yet disgraced can have a quiet shame.

  _Van._ Scipio----

  _Sy._ Some light in depth of hell. Vangue, what hope?

  _Van._ I have received assured intelligence,
  That Scipio, Rome's sole hope, hath raised up men,
  Drawn troops together for invasion----

  _Sy._ Of this same Carthage?

  _Van._ With this policy,
  To force wild Hannibal from Italy----

  _Sy._ And draw the war to Afric?

  _Van._ Right.

  _Sy._ And strike
  This secure country with unthought of arms?                      30

  _Van._ My letters bear he is departed Rome,
  Directly setting course and sailing up----

  _Sy._ To Carthage, Carthage! O thou eternal youth,
  Man of large fame, great and abounding glory,
  Renownful Scipio, spread thy two-necked eagles,
  Fill full thy sails with a revenging wind,
  Strike through obedient Neptune, till thy prows[297]
  Dash up our Libyan ooze,[298] and thy just arms
  Shine with amazeful terror on these walls!
  O now record thy father's[299] honour'd blood                    40
  Which Carthage drunk; thy uncle Publius'[300] blood
  Which Carthage drunk; thirty thousand souls
  Of choice Italians Carthage set on wing:
  Remember Hannibal, yet Hannibal,
  The consul-queller: O then enlarge thy heart,
  Be thousand souls in one! let all the breath,
  The spirit of thy name and nation, be mix'd strong
  In thy great heart! O fall like thunder-shaft,
  The wing�d vengeance of incens�d Jove,
  Upon this Carthage! for Syphax here flies off                    50
  From all allegiance, from all love or service,
  His (now free'd) sceptre once did yield this city.
  Ye universal gods, light, heat, and air,
  Prove all unblessing Syphax, if his hands
  Once rear themselves for Carthage but to curse it!
  It had been better they had changed their faith,
  Denied their gods, than slighted Syphax' love;
  So fearfully will I take vengeance.
  I'll interleague with Scipio.--Vangue,
  Dear Ethiopian negro, go wing a vessel,                          60
  And fly to Scipio: say his confederate,
  Vow'd and confirm'd, is Syphax: bid him haste
  To mix our palms and arms; will him make up,
  Whilst we are in the strength of discontent,
  Our unsuspected forces well in arms;
  For Sophonisba, Carthage, Asdrubal,
  Shall feel their weakness in preferring weakness,
  And one less great than we. To our dear wishes,
  Haste, gentle negro, that this heap may know
  Me and their wrong.                                              70

  _Van._ Wrong?

  _Sy._ Ay, tho' 'twere not; yet know, while kings are strong,
  What they'll but think, and not what is, is wrong.
  I am disgraced in and by that which hath
  No reason,--love, and woman; my revenge
  Shall therefore bear no argument of right;
  Passion is reason when it speaks from might.
  I tell thee, man, nor kings nor gods exempt,
  But they grow pale if once they find contempt.
  Haste!                                                           80

                             SCENE II.

                     SOPHONISBA'S _bedchamber_.

        _Enter_ ARCATHIA; NYCEA, _with tapers_; SOPHONISBA,
            _in her night attire, followed by_ ZANTHIA.


  _So._ Watch at the doors: and till we be reposed
  Let no one enter. Zanthia, undo me.

  _Zan._ With this motto under your girdle:
  _You had been undone if you had not been undone_.
  Humblest service!

  _So._ I wonder, Zanthia, why the custom is,
  To use such ceremony, such strict shape,
  About us women: forsooth the bride must steal
  Before her lord to bed; and then delays,
  Long expectations, all against known wishes.                     10
  I hate these figures in locution,
  These about phases forced by ceremony;
  We must still seem to fly what we most seek,
  And hide ourselves from what we fain would find.
  Let those that think and speak and do just acts,
  Know form can give no virtue to their acts,
  Nor detract vice.

  _Zan._ Alas, fair princess! those that are strongly form'd
  And truly shap'd, may naked walk; but we,
  We things call'd women, only made for show                       20
  And pleasure, created to bear children
  And play at shuttlecock; we imperfect mixtures,
  Without respective ceremony used,
  And ever compliment, alas! what are we?
  Take from us formal custom and the courtesies
  Which civil fashion hath still used to us,
  We fall to all contempt. O women, how much,
  How much are you beholding to ceremony!

  _So._ You are familiar. Zanthia, my shoe.

  _Zan._ 'Tis wonder, madam, you tread not awry.                   30

  _So._ Your reason, Zanthia.

  _Zan._ You go very high.

  _So._ Hark! music! music!

       _The Ladies lay the Princess in a fair bed, and close
             the curtains, whilst_ MASSINISSA _enters_.

  _Ny._ The bridegroom!

  _Arca._ The bridegroom!

  _So._ Haste, good Zanthia: help! keep yet the doors!

  _Zan._ Fair fall you, lady; so, admit, admit.

  _Enter four Boys, anticly attired, with bows and quivers,
     dancing to the cornets a fantastic measure_; MASSINISSA _in his
     nightgown, led by_ ASDRUBAL _and_ HANNO, _followed by_ BYTHEAS
     _and_ JUGURTH. _The Boys draw the curtains, discovering_
     SOPHONISBA, _to whom_ MASSINISSA _speaks_.

  _Mass._ You powers of joy, gods of a happy bed,
  Show you are pleased; sister and wife of Jove,
  High-fronted Juno, and thou Carthage patron,
  Smooth-chinn'd Apollo, both give modest heat
  And temperate graces!

                [MASSINISSA _draws a white ribbon forth_[301] _of the
                     bed, as from the waist of_ SOPHONISBA.

                         Lo, I unloose thy waist!
  She that is just in love is god-like chaste.                     40
  Io to Hymen!

       _Chorus, with cornets, organ and voices. Io to Hymen!_

  _So._ A modest silence, though't be thought
    A virgin's beauty and her highest honour;
  Though bashful feignings nicely wrought,
    Grace her that virtue takes not in, but on her;
  What I dare think I boldly speak:
    After my word my well-bold action rusheth.
  In open flame then passion break!
    Where virtue prompts, thought, word, act never blusheth.
  Revenging gods, whose marble hands                               50
    Crush faithless men with a confounding terror,
  Give me no mercy if these bands
    I covet not with an unfeign�d fervour;
  Which zealous vow when ought can force me t'lame,[302]
  Load with that plague Atlas would groan at, shame.
  Io to Hymen!

                       _Chorus. Io to Hymen!_

  _Asdru._ Live both high parents of so happy birth,
  Your stems may touch the skies and shadow earth;
  Most great in fame, more great in virtue shining.
  Prosper, O powers! a just, a strong divining.                    60
  Io to Hymen!

                       _Chorus. Io to Hymen!_

  _Enter_ CARTHALON, _his sword drawn, his body wounded,
    his shield struck full of darts_; MASSINISSA _being
    ready for bed_.

  _Car._ To bold hearts Fortune! be not you amazed,
  Carthage! O Carthage! be not you amazed.

  _Mass._ Jove made us not to fear; resolve, speak out;
  The highest misery of man is doubt.
  Speak, Carthalon!

  _Car._ The stooping sun, like to some weaker prince,
  Let his shades spread to an unnatural hugeness,
  When we, the camp that lay at Utica,
  From Carthage distant but five easy leagues,                     70
  Descried from off the watch three hundred sail,
  Upon whose tops the Roman eagles stretch'd
  Their large spread wings, which fann'd the evening air,
  To us cold breath; for well we might discern
  Rome swam to Carthage.

  _Asd._ Hannibal, our rancour[303] is come back; thy slight,
  Thy stratagem, to lead war unto Rome,
  To quite ourselves, hath now taught desperate Rome
  T'assail our Carthage: now the war is here.

  _Mass._ He is nor blest, nor honest, that can fear.              80

  _Han._ Ay, but to cast the worst of our distress----

  _Mass._ To doubt of what shall be, is wretchedness:
  Desire, fear, and hope, receive no bond
  By whom, we in ourselves are never but beyond.
  On!

  _Car._ Th' alarum beats necessity of fight;
  Th' unsober evening draws out reeling forces,
  Soldiers, half men, who to their colours troop
  With fury, not with valour: whilst our ships
  Unrigg'd, unus'd, fitter for fire than water,                    90
  We save in our barr'd haven from surprise.
  By this our army marcheth toward the shore,
  Undisciplin'd young men, most bold to do,
  If they knew how, or what; when we descry
  A mighty dust, beat up with horses' hooves:
  Straight Roman ensigns glitter; Scipio----

  _Asd._ Scipio!

  _Car._ Scipio, advanc�d like the god of blood,
  Leads up grim war, that father of foul wounds,
  Whose sinewy feet are steep'd in gore, whose hideous voice      100
  Makes turrets tremble and whole cities shake;
  Before whose brows flight and disorder hurry;
  With whom march burnings, murder, wrong, waste, rapes;
  Behind whom a sad train is seen, woe, fears,
  Tortures, lean need, famine, and helpless tears.
  Now make we equal stand in mutual view:
  We judg'd the Romans eighteen thousand foot,
  Five thousand horse; we almost doubled them
  In number, not in virtue;[304] yet in heat
  Of youth and wine, jolly, and full of blood,                    110
  We gave the sign of battle: shouts are raised
  That shook the heavens; pell-mell our armies join;
  Horse, targets, pikes, all against each opposed,[305]
  They give fierce shock, arms thunder'd as they clos'd:
  Men cover earth, which straight are cover�d
  With men and earth; yet doubtful stood the fight,
  More fair to Carthage, when lo, as oft we see,
  In mines of gold, when labouring slaves delve out
  The richest ore, being in sudden hope
  With some unlook'd-for vein to fill their buckets,              120
  And send huge treasure up, a sudden damp
  Stifles them all, their hands yet stuff'd with gold,--
  So fell our fortunes; for look, as we stood proud,
  Like hopeful victors, thinking to return
  With spoils worth triumph, wrathful Syphax lands
  With full ten thousand strong Numidian horse,
  And joins to Scipio. Then lo, we[306] all were damp'd;
  We fall[307] in clusters, and our wearied troops
  Quit all. Slaughter ran through us straight; we fly,
  Romans pursue, but Scipio sounds retreat,                       130
  As fearing trains and night: we make amain
  For Carthage most, and some for Utica,
  All for our lives.--New force, fresh arms with speed!

  _Han._[308] You have said truth of all; no more: I bleed.
  O[309] wretched fortune!

                                                 [_Tearing his hair._

  _Mass._ Old lord, spare thy hairs:
  What, dost thou think baldness will cure thy grief?
  What decree the Senate?

      _Enter_ GELOSSO _with commissions in his hand, sealed_.

  _Gelo._ Ask old Gelosso, who returns from them,
  Inform'd with fullest charge. Strong Asdrubal,
  Great Massinissa, Carthage general,                             140
  So speaks the Senate: counsel for this war
  In Hanno Magnus, Bytheas, Carthalon,
  And us Gelosso, rests. Embrace this charge,
  You never yet dishonour'd Asdrubal,
  High Massinissa! by your vows to Carthage,
  By th' god of great men,--glory,--fight for Carthage!
  Ten thousand strong Massulians, ready troop'd,
  Expect their king; double that number waits
  The leading of loved Asdrubal: beat loud
  Our Afric drums! and, whilst our o'er-toil'd foe                150
  Snores on his unlacked casque, all faint, though proud,
  Through his successful fight, strike fresh alarms.
  Gods are not if they grace not bold, just arms.

  _Mass._ Carthage, thou straight shalt know
  Thy favours have been done unto a king.

                                [_Exit with_ ASDRUBAL _and the Page_.

  _So._ My lords, 'tis most unusual such sad haps
  Of sudden horror should intrude 'mong beds
  Of soft and private loves; but strange events
  Excuse strange forms. O you that know our blood,
  Revenge if I do feign. I here protest,                          160
  Though my lord leave his wife a very maid,
  Even this night, instead of my soft arms
  Clasping his well-strung limbs with glossful steel,
  What's safe to Carthage shall be sweet to me.
  I must not, nor am I once ignorant
  My choice of love hath given this sudden danger
  To yet strong Carthage: 'twas I lost the fight;
  My choice vex'd Syphax, enraged Syphax struck
  Arms' fate;[310] yet Sophonisba not repents:
  O we were gods if that we knew events.                          170
  But let my[311] lord leave Carthage, quit his virtue,
  I will not love him; yet must honour him,
  As still good subjects must bad princes. Lords,
  From the most ill-graced hymeneal bed
  That ever Juno frown'd at, I entreat
  That you'll collect from our loose-form�d speech
  This firm resolve: that no low appetite
  Of my sex' weakness can or shall o'ercome
  Due grateful[312] service unto you or virtue.
  Witness, ye gods, I never until now                             180
  Repined at my creation: now I wish
  I were no woman, that my arms might speak
  My heart to Carthage. But in vain: my tongue
  Swears I am woman still, I talk too[313] long.

  _Cornets, a march. Enter two Pages with targets and javelins; two
     Pages with torches._ MASSINISSA _armed cap-�-pie_; ASDRUBAL
     _armed_.

  _Mass._ Ye Carthage lords, know Massinissa knows
  Not only terms of honour, but his actions;
  Nor must I now enlarge how much my cause
  Hath danger'd Carthage, but how I may show
  Myself most prest[314] to satisfaction.
  The loathsome stain of kings' ingratitude                       190
  From me O much be far! And since this torrent,
  War's rage, admits no anchor--since the billow
  Is risen so high we may not hull,[315] but yield
  This ample state to stroke of speedy swords;
  What you with sober haste have well decreed,
  We'll put to sudden arms; no, not this night,
  These dainties, these firstfruits of nuptials,
  That well might give excuse for feeble lingerings,
  Shall hinder Massinissa. Appetite,
  Kisses, loves, dalliance, and what softer joys                  200
  The Venus of the pleasing'st ease can minister,
  I quit you all. Virtue perforce is vice;
  But he that may, yet holds, is manly wise.
  Lo then, ye lords of Carthage, to your trust
  I leave all Massinissa's treasure: by the oath
  Of right good men stand to my fortune just:
  Most hard it is for great hearts to mistrust.

  _Car._ We vow by all high powers.

  _Mass._ No, do not swear;
  I was not born so small to doubt or fear.

  _So._ Worthy, my lord----

  _Mass._ Peace, my ears are steel;                               210
  I must not hear thy much-enticing voice.

  _So._ My Massinissa, Sophonisba speaks
  Worthy thy wife: go with as high a hand
  As worth can rear.  I will not stay my lord.
  Fight for our country; vent thy youthful heat
  In field, not beds: the fruit of honour, Fame,
  Be rather gotten than the oft disgrace
  Of hapless parents, children. Go, best man,
  And make me proud to be a soldier's wife,
  That values his renown above faint pleasures:                   220
  Think every honour that doth grace thy sword
  Trebles my love. By thee I have no lust
  But of thy glory. Best lights of heaven with thee!
  Like wonder, stand or fall; so, though thou die,
  My fortunes may be wretched, but not I.

  _Mass._ Wondrous creature! even fit for gods, not men:
  Nature made all the rest of thy fair sex
  As weak essays, to make thee a pattern
  Of what can be in woman! Long farewell!
  He's sure unconquer'd in whom thou dost dwell,                  230
  Carthage Palladium.[316] See that glorious lamp--
  Whose lifeful[317] presence giveth sudden flight
  To fancies, fogs, fears, sleep, and slothful night--
  Spreads day upon the world: march swift amain;--
  Fame got with loss of breath is god-like gain!

                              SCENE I.

                  _The Senate-house at Carthage._

  _Whilst the music for the first Act sounds_, HANNO, CARTHALON,
     BYTHEAS, GELOSSO, _enter: they place themselves to counsel_,
     GISCO, _the impoisoner, waiting on them_; HANNO, CARTHALON, _and_
     BYTHEAS _setting their hands to a writing, which being offered
     to_ GELOSSO, _he denies his hand, and, as much offended,
     impatiently starts up and speaks_.

            _Enter_ GELOSSO, HANNO, BYTHEAS, CARTHALON.


  _Gel._ My hand? my hand? rot first; wither in aged shame.

  _Han._ Will you be so unseasonably wood?[318]

  _By._ Hold such preposterous zeal as stand[319] against
  The full decree of Senate, all think fit?

  _Car._ Nay, most inevitable[320] necessary
  For Carthage' safety, and the now sole good
  Of present state, that we must break all faith
  With Massinissa. Whilst he fights abroad,
  Let's gain back Syphax, making him our own,
  By giving Sophonisba to his bed.                                 10

  _Han._ Syphax is Massinissa's greater, and his force
  Shall give more side to Carthage: as for's queen,
  And her wise father, they love Carthage fate;
  Profit and honesty are not one in state.

  _Gel._ And what decrees our very virtuous Senate
  Of worthy Massinissa, that now fights,
  And (leaving wife and bed) bleeds in good arms
  For right old Carthage?

  _Car._ Thus 'tis thought fit:
  Her father, Asdrubal, on sudden shall take in
  Revolted Syphax; so with doubled strength,                       20
  Before that Massinissa shall suspect,
  Slaughter both Massinissa and his troops,
  And likewise strike with his deep stratagem
  A sudden weakness into Scipio's arms,
  By drawing such a limb from the main body
  Of his yet powerful army: which being done,
  Dead Massinissa's kingdom we decree
  To Sophonisba and great Asdrubal
  For their consent; so this swift plot shall bring
  Two crowns to her, make Asdrubal a king.                         30

  _Gel._ So, first faith's breach, murder, adultery, theft!

  _Car._ What else?

  _Gel._ Nay, all is done, no mischief left.

  _Car._ Pish!
  Prosperous success gives blackest actions glory;
  The means are unremember'd in most story.

  _Gel._ Let me not say gods are not.

  _Car._ This is fit:
  Conquest by blood is not so sweet as wit:
  For howsoe'er nice virtue censures[321] it,
  He hath the grace of war that hath war's profit.
  But Carthage, well advised that states come on                   40
  With slow advice, quick execution,
  Have here an engineer long bred for plots,
  Call'd an impois'ner, who knows this sound excuse:
  Th' only dew that makes men sprout in court is use.
  Be't well or ill, his thrift is to be mute;
  Such slaves must act commands, and not dispute.
  Knowing foul deeds with danger do begin,
  But with rewards do end: sin is no sin,
  But in respects----

  _Gel._ Politic lord, speak low: though Heaven bears
  A face far from us, gods have most long ears;                    51
  Jove has a hundred marble marble hands.

  _Car._ O ay, in poetry or tragic scene!

  _Gel._ I fear gods only know what poets mean.

  _Car._ Yet hear me, I will speak close truth and cease:
  Nothing in Nature is unserviceable,
  No, not even inutility itself.
  Is then for nought dishonesty in being?
  And if it be sometimes of forc�d use,
  Wherein more urgent than in saving nations?                      60
  State shapes are solder'd up with base, nay faulty,
  Yet necessary functions: some must lie,
  Some must betray, some murder, and some all;
  Each hath strong use, as poison in all purges:
  Yet when some violent chance shall force a state
  To break given faith, or plot some stratagems,
  Princes ascribe that vile necessity
  Unto Heaven's wrath. And sure, though't be no vice,
  Yet 'tis bad chance: states must not stick too nice,
  For Massinissa's death sense bids forgive:                       70
  Beware t'offend great men, and let them live;
  For 'tis of empire's body the main arm,--
  He that will do no good shall do no harm.
  You have my mind.

  _Gel._ Although a stage-like passion, and weak heat,
  Full of an empty wording, might suit age,
  Know I'll speak strongly truth. Lords, ne'er mistrust,
  That he who'll not betray a private man
  For his country, will ne'er betray his country
  For private men; then give Gelosso faith.                        80
  If treachery in state be serviceable,
  Let hangmen do it. I am bound to lose
  My life, but not mine honour, for my country.
  Our vows, our faith, our oaths, why they're ourselves,
  And he that's faithless to his proper self
  May be excus'd if he break faith with princes.
  The gods assist just hearts, and states that trust
  Plots before Providence are toss'd like dust.
  For Massinissa (O, let me slack a little
  Austere discourse and feel humanity!)                            90
  Methinks I hear him cry, "O fight for Carthage!
  Charge home! wounds smart not for that so just, so great,
  So good a city." Methinks I see him yet
  Leave his fair bride, even on his nuptial night,
  To buckle on his arms for Carthage. Hark!
  Yet, yet, I hear him cry,--"Ingratitude,
  Vile stain of man, O ever be most far
  From Massinissa's breast! Up, march amain;
  Fame got by loss of breath is god-like gain!"
  And see, by this he bleeds in doubtful[322] fight,              100
  And cries "For Carthage!" whilst Carthage--Memory,
  Forsake Gelosso! would I could not think,
  Nor hear, nor be, when Carthage is
  So infinitely vile! See, see! look here!

  _Cornets. Enter two_ Ushers; SOPHONISBA, ZANTHIA, _and_ ARCATHIA;
     HANNO, BYTHEAS, _and_ CARTHALON _present_ SOPHONISBA _with a
     paper, which she having perused, after a short silence, speaks_.

  _So._ Who speaks? What, mute? Fair plot! What? blush to break it?
  How lewd to act when so shamed but to speak it.
  Is this the Senate's firm decree?[323]

  _Car._ It is.

  _So._ Is this the Senate's firm decree?

  _Car._ It is.

  _So._ Hath Syphax entertained the stratagem?

  _Car._ No doubt he hath or will.

  _So._ My answer's thus,                                         110
  What's safe to Carthage shall be sweet to us.[324]

  _Car._ Right worthy.

  _Han._ Royalest.

  _Gel._ O very woman!

  _So._ But 'tis not safe for Carthage to destroy.
  Be most unjust, cunningly politic,
  Your head's still under heaven. O trust to Fate:
  Gods prosper more a just than crafty state;
  'Tis less disgrace to have a pitied loss,
  Than shameful victory.

  _Gel._ O very angel!

  _So._ We all have sworn good Massinissa faith;
  Speech makes us men, and there's no other bond                  120
  'Twixt man and man but words. O equal gods!
  Make us once know the consequence of vows--

  _Gel._ And we shall hate faith-breakers worse than man-eaters.

  _So._ Ha, good Gelosso, is thy breath not here?

  _Gel._ You do me wrong: as long as I can die,
  Doubt you that old Gelosso can be vile?
  States may afflict, tax, torture, but our minds
  Are only sworn to Jove. I grieve, and yet am proud
  That I alone am honest: high powers, ye know
  Virtue is seldom seen with troops to go.                        130

  _So._ Excellent man! Carthage and Rome shall fall
  Before thy fame.--Our lords, know I the worst?

  _Car._ The gods foresaw, 'tis fate we thus are forc'd.

  _So._ Gods naught foresee, but see, for to their eyes
  Naught is to come or past; nor are you vile
  Because the gods foresee; for gods, not[325] we,
  See as things are; things are not as[326] we see.
  But since affected wisdom in us women
  Is our sex' highest folly, I am silent;
  I cannot speak less well, unless I were                         140
  More void of goodness. Lords of Carthage, thus:
  The air and earth of Carthage owes[327] my body;
  It is their servant; what decree they of it?

  _Car._ That you remove to Cirta, to the palace
  Of well-form'd Syphax, who with longing eyes
  Meets you: he that gives way to Fate is wise.

  _So._ I go: what power can make me wretched? what evil
  Is there in life to him that knows life's loss
  To be no evil? show, show thy ugliest brow,
  O most black chance; make me a wretched story:                  150
  Without misfortune virtue hath no glory;
  Oppos�d trees makes tempests show their power,
  And waves forced back by rocks makes Neptune tower,--
  Tearless O see a miracle of life,
  A maid, a widow, yet a hapless wife!

                        [_Cornets._ SOPHONISBA, _accompanied with the
                              Senators, departs; only_ GELOSSO _stays_.

  _Gel._ A prodigy! let Nature run cross-legg'd,
  Ops go upon his head, let Neptune burn,
  Cold Saturn crack with heat, for now the world
  Hath seen a woman!
  Leap nimble lightning from Jove's ample shield,                 160
  And make at length an end! The proud hot breath
  Of thee-contemning greatness; the huge drought
  Of sole self-loving vast ambition;
  Th' unnatural scorching heat of all those lamps
  Thou rear'dst to yield a temperate fruitful heat;
  Relentless rage, whose heart hath no one drop
  Of human pity;--all, all loudly cry,
  Thy brand, O Jove, for now[328] the world is dry!
  O let a general end save Carthage fame!
  When worlds do burn, unseen's a city's flame.                   170
  Phoebus in me is great; Carthage must fall;
  Jove hates all vice, but vows' breach worst of all.

                                                             [_Exit._

                             SCENE II.

                           _Near Cirta._

  _Cornets sound a charge. Enter_ MASSINISSA _in his gorget_[329]
     _and shirt, shield, sword; his arm transfix'd with a
     dart_. JUGURTH _follows, with his cuirass and casque_.


  _Mass._ Mount us again; give us another horse!

  _Jug._ Uncle, your blood flows fast: pray ye withdraw.

  _Mass._ O Jugurth, I cannot bleed too fast, too much,
  For that so great, so just, so royal Carthage!
  My wound smarts not, blood's loss makes me not faint,
  For that loved city. O nephew, let me tell thee,
  How good that Carthage is: it nourish'd me,
  And when full time gave me fit strength for love,
  The most ador�d creature of the city,
  To us before great Syphax did they yield,--                      10
  Fair, noble, modest, and 'bove all, my [own],
  My Sophonisba! O Jugurth, my strength doubles:
  I know not how to turn a coward,--drop
  In feeble baseness I cannot. Give me horse!
  Know I'm Carthage' very creature, and am grac'd
  That I may bleed for them. Give me fresh horse!

  _Jug._ He that doth public good for multitude,
  Finds few are truly grateful.

  _Mass._ O Jugurth! fie! you must not say so. Jugurth,
  Some[330] common-weals may let a noble heart                     20
  Even bleed to death abroad, and not bemoan'd,
  Neither revenged, at home. But, Carthage, fie!
  It cannot be ungrate, faithless through fear:
  It cannot, Jugurth: Sophonisba's there.
  Beat a fresh charge!

       _Enter_ ASDRUBAL, _his sword drawn, reading a letter_;
                        GISCO _follows him_.

  _Asd._ Sound the retreat; respect your health, brave prince;
  The waste of blood throws paleness on your face.

  _Mass._ By light, my heart's not pale: O my loved father,
  We bleed for Carthage; balsam to my wounds,
  We bleed for Carthage; shall's restore the fight?                30
  My squadron of Massulians yet stands firm.

  _Asd._ The day looks off from Carthage; cease alarms!
  A modest temperance is the life of arms.
  Take our best surgeon Gisco; he is sent
  From Carthage to attend your chance of war.

  _Gis._ We promise sudden ease.

  _Mass._ Thy comfort's good.

  _Asd._ --That nothing can secure us but thy blood!
  Infuse it in his wound, 'twill work amain.

  _Gis._ --O Jove!

  _Asd._ --What Jove? thy god must be thy gain,--
  And as for me----Apollo Pythian,                                 40
  Thou know'st a statist[331] must not be a man.

                                                    [_Exit_ ASDRUBAL.

  _Enter_ GELOSSO _disguised like an old soldier, delivering to_
     MASSINISSA (_as he is preparing to be dressed by_ GISCO) _a
     letter, which_ MASSINISSA _reading, starts, and speaks to_ GISCO.

  _Mass._ Forbear; how art thou call'd?

  _Gis._ Gisco, my lord.

  _Mass._ Um, Gisco. Ha! touch not my arm.--[_To_ GELOSSO.] Most
      only man!--
  [_To_ Gisco.] Sirra, sirra, art poor?

  _Gis._ Not poor.

  _Mass._ Nephew, command

                                        [MASSINISSA _begins to draw_.

  Our troops of horse make indisgraced retreat;
  Trot easy off.--Not poor!--Jugurth, give charge
  My soldiers stand in square battalia,

                                                     [_Exit_ JUGURTH.

  Entirely of themselves.--Gisco, th' art old;
  'Tis time to leave off murder; thy faint breath
  Scarce heaves thy ribs, thy gummy blood-shut eyes                50
  Are sunk a great way in thee, thy lank skin
  Slides from thy fleshless veins: be good to men.
  Judge him, ye gods: I had not life to kill
  So base a creature. Hold, Gisco, live;
  The god-like part of kings is to forgive.

  _Gis._ Command astonish'd Gisco.

  _Mass._ No, return.
  Haste unto Carthage, quit thy abject fears,
  Massinissa knows no use of murderers.

                                                       [_Exit_ GISCO.

            _Enter_ JUGURTH, _amazed, his sword drawn_.

  Speak, speak! let terror strike slaves mute,
  Much danger makes great hearts most resolute.                    60

  _Jug._ Uncle, I fear foul arms; myself beheld
  Syphax on high speed run his well-breath'd horse
  Direct to Cirta, that most beauteous city
  Of all his kingdom; whilst his troops of horse,
  With careless trot, pace gently toward our camp,
  As friends to Carthage. Stand on guard, dear uncle;
  For Asdrubal, with yet his well-rank'd army,
  Bends a deep threat'ning brow to us, as if
  He waited but to join with Syphax' horse,
  And hew us all to pieces. O my king,                             70
  My uncle, father, captain, O over all!
  Stand like thyself, or like thyself now fall!
  Thy troops yet hold good ground. Unworthy wounds,
  Betray not Massinissa!

  _Mass._ Jugurth, pluck,
  Pluck! so, good coz.

  _Jug._ O God! Do you not feel?

  _Mass._ Not, Jugurth, no; now all my flesh is steel.

  _Gel._ Off base disguise! high lights scorn not to view
  A true old man. Up, Massinissa! throw
  The lot of battle upon Syphax' troops,
  Before he join with Carthage; then amain                         80
  Make through to Scipio; he yields safe abodes:
  Spare treachery, and strike the very gods.

  _Mass._ Why wast thou born at Carthage! O my fate!
  Divinest Sophonisba! I am full
  Of much complaint, and many passions,
  The least of which express'd would sad the gods,
  And strike compassion in most[332] ruthless hell.
  Up, unmaim'd heart, spend all thy grief and rage
  Upon thy foe! the field's a soldier's stage,
  On which his action shows. If you are just,                      90
  And hate those that contemn you, O you gods,
  Revenge worthy your anger, your anger! O,
  Down man, up heart! stoop Jove, and bend thy chin
  To thy large breast; give sign th'art pleased, and just;
  Swear good men's foreheads must not print the dust.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                             SCENE III.

                            _Carthage._

                 _Enter_ ASDRUBAL, HANNO, BYTHEAS.


  _Asd._ What Carthage hath decreed, Hanno, is done;
  Advanced and born was Asdrubal for state;
  Only with it, his faith, his love, his hate,
  Are of one piece. Were it my daughter's life
  That, fate hath sung, to Carthage safety brings,
  What deed so red but hath been done by kings?
  Iphigenia--He that's a man for men,
  Ambitious as a god, must, like a god,
  Live free from passions; his full aim'd at end,
  Immense to others, sole self to comprehend,                      10
  Round in's own globe; not to be clasp'd, but holds
  Within him all; his heart being of more folds
  Than shield of Telamon, not to be pierc'd, though struck:
  The god of wise men is themselves, not luck.

                           _Enter_ GISCO.

  See him by whom now Massinissa is not.
  Gisco, is't done?

  _Gis._ Your pardon, worthy lord,
  It is not done, my heart sunk in my breast,
  His virtue mazed me, faintness seized me all:
  Some god's in kings, that will not let them fall.                19

  _Asd._ His virtue mazed thee! (umh) why now I see
  Th'art that just man that hath true touch of blood,
  Of pity, and soft piety. Forgive?
  Yes, honour thee; we did it but to try
  What sense thou hadst of blood. Go, Bytheas,
  Take him into our private treasury--
  [_Aside to_ BYTHEAS] And cut his throat; the slave hath all
      betray'd.

  _By._ --Are you assured?

  _Asd._ --Afear'd, for this I know,
  Who thinketh to buy villainy with gold,
  Shall ever find such faith so bought, so sold.--
  Reward him thoroughly.

                           [_A shout; the cornets giving a flourish._

  _Han._ What means this shout?                                    30

  _Asd._ Hanno, 'tis done. Syphax' revolt by this
  Hath secured Carthage; and now his force come in,
  And join'd with us, give Massinissa charge,
  And assured slaughter. O ye powers! forgive,
  Through rotten'st dung best plants both sprout and live;
  By blood[333] vines grow.

  _Han._ But yet think, Asdrubal,
  'Tis fit at least you bear grief's outward show;
  It is your kinsman bleeds. What need men know
  Your hand is in his wounds? 'Tis well in state
  To do close ill, but 'void a public hate.                        40

  _Asd._ Tush, Hanno! let me prosper, let routs prate;
  My power shall force their silence or my hate.
  I scorn their idle malice: men of weight
  Know, he that fears envy let him cease to reign;
  The people's hate to some hath been their gain.
  For howsoe'er a monarch feigns his parts,
  Steal anything from kings but subjects' hearts.

           _Enter_ CARTHALON _leading in bound_ GELOSSO.

  _Car._ Guard, guard the camp!--make to the trench!--stand firm!

  _Asd._ The gods of boldness with us!--how runs chance?

  _Car._ Think, think how wretched thou canst be, thou art;        50
  Short words shall speak long woes.

  _Gel._ Mark, Asdrubal.

  _Car._ Our bloody plot to Massinissa's ear
  Untimely by this lord was all betrayed.

  _Gel._ By me it was; by me, vile Asdrubal;
  I joy to speak't.

  _Asd._ Down, slave!

  _Gel._ I cannot fall.

  _Car._ Our train's disclosed, straight to his well-used arms
  He took himself, rose up with all his force
  On Syphax' careless troops, Syphax being hurried
  Before to Cirta, fearless of success,
  Impatient Sophonisba to enjoy;                                   60
  Gelosso rides to head of all our squadrons,
  Commands make stand in thy name, Asdrubal,
  In mine, in his, in all: they all obey;
  Whilst Massinissa, now with more than fury,
  Chargeth the loose and much-amaz�d ranks
  Of absent Syphax, who with broken shout
  (In vain expecting Carthage secondings)
  Give faint repulse. A second charge is given:
  Then look, as when a falcon towers aloft,
  Whole shoals of fowl and flocks of lesser birds                  70
  Crouch fearfully, and dive; some among sedge,
  Some creep in brakes: so Massinissa's sword,
  Brandish'd aloft, toss'd 'bout his shining casque,
  Made stoop whole squadrons; quick as thought he strikes,
  Here hurls he darts, and there his rage-strong arm
  Fights foot to foot; here cries he "strike! they sink!"
  And then grim slaughter follows; for by this,
  As men betray'd, they curse us, die, or fly, or both;
  Six thousand fell at once. Now was I come,
  And straight perceived all bled by his vile plot.                80

  _Gel._ Vile! Good plot! my good plot, Asdrubal!

  _Car._ I forced our army beat a running march;
  But Massinissa struck his spurs apace
  Upon his speedy horse, leaves slaughtering;
  All fly to Scipio, who with open ranks
  In view receives them: all I could effect
  Was but to gain him.

  _Asd._ Die!

  _Gel._ Do what thou can,
  Thou canst but kill a weak old honest man.

                                         [GELOSSO _departs, guarded_.

  _Car._ Scipio and Massinissa by this strike
  Their clasp�d palms, then vow an endless love;                   90
  Straight a joint shout they raise, then turn they breasts
  Direct on us, march strongly toward our camp,
  As if they dared us fight. O Asdrubal,
  I fear they'll force our camp.

  _Asd._ Break up and fly.--
  This was your plot.

  _Han._ But 'twas thy shame to choose it.

  _Car._ He that forbids not offence, he does it.

  _Asd._ The curse of women's words go with you.--Fly!--
  You are no villains!--Gods and men, which way?--
  Advise vile things!

  _Han._ Vile?

  _Asd._ Ay!

  _Car._ Not?

  _By._ You did all.

  _Asd._ Did you not plot?

  _Car._ Yielded not Asdrubal?                                    100

  _Asd._ But you enticed me.

  _Han._ How?

  _Asd._ With hope of place.

  _Car._ He that for wealth leaves faith, is abject.

  _Han._ Base.

  _Asd._ Do not provoke my sword; I live.

  _Car._ More shame,
  T' outlive thy virtue and thy once great name.

  _Asd._ Upbraid ye me?

  _Han._ Hold!

  _Car._ Know that only thou
  Art treacherous: thou shouldst have had a crown.

  _Han._ Thou didst all, all; he for whom mischief's done,
  He does it.

  _Asd._ Brook[334] open scorn, faint powers!--
  Make good the camp!--No, fly!--yes, what?--wild rage!--         110
  To be a prosperous villain! yet some heat, some hold;
  But to burn temples, and yet freeze, O cold!
  Give me some health; now your blood sinks: thus deeds
  Ill nourish'd rot; without Jove nought succeeds.

                                                           [_Exeunt._

                            ACT III.[335]


                              SCENE I.

                 _The Palace of_ SYPHAX _at Cirta_.

  SYPHAX, _with his dagger twon_[336] _about her hair, drags in_
     SOPHONISBA _in her nightgown and petticoat_; ZANTHIA
     _and_ VANGUE _following_.


  _Sy._ Must we entreat? sue to such squeamish ears?
  Know, Syphax has no knees, his eyes no tears;
  Enrag�d love is senseless of remorse.
  Thou shalt, thou must: kings' glory is their force.
  Thou art in Cirta, in my palace, fool:
  Dost think he pitieth tears that knows to rule?
  For all thy scornful eyes, thy proud disdain,
  And late contempt of us, now we'll revenge,
  Break stubborn silence. Look, I'll tack thy head
  To the low earth, whilst strength of two black knaves            10
  Thy limbs all wide shall strain. Prayer fitteth slaves,
  Our courtship be our force: rest calm as sleep,
  Else at this quake; hark, hark, we cannot weep.

  _So._ Can Sophonisba be enforc'd?

  _Sy._ Can? see.

  _So._ Thou mayest enforce my body, but not me.

  _Sy._ Not?

  _So._ No.

  _Sy._ No?

  _So._ No: off with thy loath�d arms,
  That lie more heavy on me than the chains
  That wear deep wrinkles in the captive's limbs!
  I do beseech thee.

  _Sy._ What?

  _So._ Be but a beast,
  Be but a beast.

  _Sy._ Do not offend a power                                      20
  Can make thee more than wretched: yield to him
  To whom fate yields. Know, Massinissa's dead.

  _So._ Dead!

  _Sy._ Dead.

  _So._ To gods' and[337] good men's shame.

  _Sy._ Help, Vangue, my strong blood boils.

  _So._ O[338] yet save thine own fame.

  _Sy._ All appetite is deaf; I will, I must.
  Achilles' armour could not bar[339] out lust.

  _So._ Hold thy strong arm, and hear me. Syphax, know
  I am thy servant now: I needs must love thee,
  For (O, my sex, forgive!) I must confess
  We not affect protesting feebleness,                             30
  Entreats, faint blushings, timorous modesty;
  We think our lover is but little man,
  Who is so full of woman. Know, fair Prince,
  Love's strongest arm's not rude; for we still prove,
  Without some fury there's no ardent love.
  We love our love's impatience of delay;
  Our noble[340] sex was only born t'obey,
  To him that dares command.

  _Sy._ Why, this is well;
  Th' excuse is good: wipe thy fair eyes, our Queen,
  Make proud thy head; now feel more friendly strength
  Of thy lord's arm: come, touch my rougher skin                   41
  With thy soft lip. Zanthia, dress our bed.
  Forget old loves, and clip him that through blood
  And hell acquires his wish; think not but kiss,
  The flourish fore love's fight and[341] Venus' bliss.

  _So._ Great dreadful lord, by thy affection,
  Grant me one boon. Know I have made a vow--

  _Sy._ Vow! what vow? speak.

  _So._ Nay, if you take offence,
  Let my soul suffer first, and yet----

  _Sy._ Offence?
  Not, Sophonisba; hold, thy vow is free                           50
  As----come, thy lips!

  _So._ Alas, cross misery!
  As I do wish to live, I long t'enjoy
  Your warm embrace; but, oh my vow, 'tis thus:
  If ever my lord died, I vow'd to him
  A most, most private sacrifice, before
  I touch'd a second spouse. All I implore,
  Is but this liberty.

  _Sy._ This? go, obtain.
  What time?

  _So._ One hour.

  _Sy._ Sweet, good speed, speed, adieu!--
  Yet, Syphax, trust no more than thou may'st view.--
  Vangue shall stay.

  _So._ He stays.

     _Enter a Page, delivering a letter to_ SOPHONISBA, _which
                       she privately reads_.

  _Sy._ Zanthia, Zanthia!                                          60
  Thou art not foul, go to; some lords are oft
  So much in love with their known ladies' bodies,
  That they oft love their--Vails:[342] hold, hold, thou'st find
  To faithful care kings' bounty hath no shore.

  _Zan._ You may do much.

  _Sy._ But let my gold do more.

  _Zan._ I am your creature.

  _Sy._ Be yet;[343] 'tis no stain;
  The god of service is however gain.

                                                             [_Exit._

  _So._ Zanthia, where are we now? speak worth my service;
  Ha' we done well?

  _Zan._ Nay, in height of best
  I fear'd a superstitious virtue would spoil all,                 70
  But now I find you above women rare.
  She that can time her goodness hath true care
  Of her best good. Nature at home begins;
  She, whose integrity herself hurts, sins.
  For Massinissa, he was good, and so;
  But he is dead, or worse, distress'd, or more
  Than dead, or much distress'd. O sad, poor,--
  Who ever held such friends? no, let him go;
  Such faith is praised, then laugh'd at; for still know
  Those are the living women that reduce                           80
  All that they touch unto their ease and use,
  Knowing that wedlock, virtue, or good names,
  Are courses and varieties of reason,
  To use or leave, as they advantage them,
  And absolute within themselves reposed,
  Only to greatness ope, to all else closed.
  Weak sanguine fools are to their own good nice;
  Before I held you virtuous, but now wise.

  _So._ Zanthia, victorious Massinissa lives,
  My Massinissa lives. O steady powers,                            90
  Keep him as safe as heaven keeps the earth,
  Which looks upon it with a thousand eyes!
  That honest valiant man! and Zanthia,
  Do but record the justice of his love,
  And my for ever vows, for ever vows!

  _Zan._ Ay, true madam; nay, think of his great mind,
  His most just heart, his all of excellence,
  And such a virtue as the gods might envy.
  Against this, Syphax, is but----and you know,
  Fame lost, what can be got that's good for----

  _So._ Hence!                                                    100
  Take, nay, with one hand.

  _Zan._ My service.

  _So._ Prepare
  Our sacrifice.

  _Zan._ But yield you, ay or no?

  _So._ When thou dost know.

  _Zan._ What then?

  _So._ Then thou wilt know.

                                                     [_Exit_ ZANTHIA.

  Let him that would have counsel 'void th' advice
  Of friends, made his with weighty benefits,
  Whose much dependence only strives to fit
  Humour, not reason, and so still devise
  In any thought to make their friend seem wise.
  But above all, O fear a servant's tongue,
  Like such as only for their gain do[344] serve.                 110
  Within the vast capacity of space,[345]
  I know no vileness so most truly base.
  Their lord's their gain; and he that most will give,
  With him (they will not die, but) they will live.
  Traitors and these are one; such slaves once trust,
  Whet swords to make thine own blood lick the dust.

  _Cornets and organs playing full music, enter under the conduct
      of_ ZANTHIA _and_ VANGUE, _the solemnity of a sacrifice; which
      being entered, whilst the attendants furnish the altar_,
      SOPHONISBA _sings a song; which done, she speaks_.

  Withdraw, withdraw; all but Zanthia and Vangue depart.--

                                                [_Exeunt attendants._

  I not invoke thy arm, thou god of sound,--
  Nor thine, nor thine,--although in all abound
  High powers immense. But jovial Mercury,                        120
  And thou, O brightest female of the sky,
  Thrice-modest Phoebe, you that jointly fit
  A worthy chastity and a most chaste wit,
  To you corruptless honey and pure dew
  Upbreathes our holy fire; words just and few,
  O deign to hear! if in poor wretches' cries
  You glory not; if drops of withered eyes
  Be not your sport, be just; all that I crave
  Is but chaste life, or an untainted grave.
  I can no more; yet hath my constant tongue                      130
  Let fall no weakness, tho' my heart were wrung
  With pangs worth hell; whilst great thoughts stop our tears,
  Sorrow unseen, unpitied, inward wears:
  You see now where I rest, come is my end.
  Cannot Heaven virtue 'gainst weak chance defend?
  When weakness hath out-borne what weakness can,--
  What should I say?--'tis Jove's, not sin of man.
  --Some stratagem now! let wit's God be shown,
  Celestial powers by miracles are known.
  I have't; 'tis done.--Zanthia, prepare our bed.                 140
  Vangue!

  _Van._ Your servant.

  _So._ Vangue, we have perform'd
  Due rites unto the dead.

                          [SOPHONISBA _presents a carouse to_ VANGUE.

  Now to thy lord, great Syphax, healthful cups,
  Which done, the king is right much welcome.

  _Van._ Were it as deep as thought, off it should thus.

                                                        [_He drinks._

  _So._ My safety with that draught.

  _Van._ Close the vault's mouth lest we do slip in drink.

  _So._ To what use, gentle negro, serves this cave,
  Whose mouth thus opens so familiarly,
  Even in the king's bedchamber?

  _Van._ O, my queen,                                             150
  This vault with hideous darkness, and much length,
  Stretcheth beneath the earth into a grove,
  One league from Cirta (I am very sleepy);
  Through this, when Cirta hath been strong begirt,
  With hostile siege the king hath safely 'scaped
  To, to----

  _So._ The wine is strong.

  _Van._ Strong?

  _So._ Zanthia!

  _Zan._ What means my princess?

  _So._ Zanthia, rest firm
  And silent. Help us; nay, do not dare refuse.

  _Zan._ The negro's dead!

  _So._ No, drunk.

  _Zan._ Alas!

  _So._ Too late!
  Her hand is fearful whose mind's desperate.                     160
  It is but sleepy opium he hath drunk.
  Help, Zanthia!

                        [_They lay_ VANGUE _in_ SYPHAX' _bed and draw
                              the curtains_.

  There lie Syphax' bride; a naked man is soon undress'd;
  There bide dishonoured passion.

                      [_They knock within, forthwith_ SYPHAX _comes_.

  _Sy._ Way for the king!

  _So._ Straight for the king. I fly
  Where misery shall see nought but itself.
  Dear Zanthia, close the vault when I am sunk,
  And whilst he slips to bed, escape; be true;
  I can no more; come to me. Hark, gods, my breath
  Scorns to crave life, grant but a well-famed death.             170

                                                     [_She descends._

         _Enter_ SYPHAX, _ready for bed, with attendants_.

  _Sy._ Each man withdraw, let not a creature stay
  Within large distance.

  _Zan._ Sir!

  _Sy._ Hence, Zanthia!
  Not thou shalt hear; all stand without ear-reach
  Of the soft cries nice shrinking brides do yield,
  When----

  _Zan._ But, sir----

  _Sy._ Hence!--stay, take thy delight by steps,
  Think of thy joys, and make long thy pleasures.
  O silence, thou dost swallow pleasure right;
  Words take away some sense from our delight.
  Music!                                                          180
  Be proud, my Venus; Mercury, thy tongue;
  Cupid, thy flame; 'bove all, O Hercules,
  Let not thy back be wanting; for now I leap
  To catch the fruit none but the gods should reap.

                   [_Offering to leap into bed, he discovers_ VANGUE.

  Hah! can any woman turn to such a devil?
  Or--or--Vangue, Vangue----

  _Van._ Yes, yes.

  _Sy._ Speak, slave!
  How camest thou here?

  _Van._ Here?

  _Sy._ Zanthia, Zanthia!
  Where's Sophonisba? speak at full--at full.
  Give me particular faith, or know thou art not----

  _Zan._ Your pardon, just-moved prince, and private ear.         190

  _Sy._ Ill actions have some grace, that they can fear.

  _Van._ How came I laid? which way was I made drunk?
  Where am I? think I, or is my state advanced?
  O Jove, how pleasant is it but to sleep,
  In a king's bed!

  _Sy._ Sleep there thy lasting sleep,
  Improvident, base, o'er-thirsty slave.

                                              [SYPHAX _kills_ VANGUE.

  Die pleased, a king's couch is thy too-proud grave.--
  Through this vault say'st thou?

  _Zan._ As you give me grace
  To live, 'tis true.

  _Sy._ We will be good to Zanthia;
  Go, cheer thy lady, and be private to us.                       200

  _Zan._ As to my life.

                                    [_She descends after_ SOPHONISBA.

  _Sy._ I'll use this Zanthia,
  And trust her as our dogs drink dangerous Nile[346]
  (Only for thirst), that[347] fly the crocodile.
  Wise Sophonisba knows love's tricks of art:
  Without much hindrance pleasure hath no heart.
  Despite all virtue or weak plots I must:
  Seven-wall�d Babel cannot bar[348] out lust.

                                       [_Descends through the vault._

                             SCENE II.

                     _Neighbourhood of Utica._

  _Enter_ SCIPIO _and_ L�LIUS, _with the complements of Roman
     Generals before them_. _At the other door_, MASSINISSA
     _and_ JUGURTH. _Cornets sound marches._


  _Mass._ Let not the virtue of the world suspect
  Sad Massinissa's faith; nor once condemn
  Our just revolt. Carthage first gave me life;
  Her ground gave food, her air first lent me breath:
  The earth was made for men, not men for earth.
  Scipio, I do not thank the gods for life,
  Much less vile men, or earth; know, best of lords,
  It is a happy being, breath well famed,
  For which Jove sees these thus.[349] Men, be not fool'd
  With piety to place, tradition's fear;                           10
  A just man's country Jove makes everywhere.

  _Sci._ Well urgeth Massinissa; but to leave
  A city so ingrate, so faithless, so more vile
  Than civil speech can name, fear not; such vice
  To scourge is Heaven's grateful sacrifice.
  Thus all confess, first they have broke a faith
  To the[e] most due, so just to be observed,
  That barbarousness itself may well blush at them:
  Where is thy passion? They have shared thy crown,
  The proper right of birth, contrived thy death:                  20
  Where is thy passion? Given thy beauteous spouse
  To thy most hated rival. Statue, not man!
  And last, thy friend Gelosso (man worth gods)
  With tortures have they rent to death.

  _Mass_. O Gelosso!
  For thee full eyes----

  _Sci._ No passion for the rest?

  _Mass._ O Scipio,
  My grief for him may be expressed by tears,
  But for the rest, silence, and secret anguish
  Shall waste--shall waste! Scipio, he that can weep,
  Grieves not, like me, private deep inward drops                  30
  Of blood. My heart! for god's right give me leave
  To be a short time man.

  _Sci._ Stay, prince.

  _Mass._ I cease;
  Forgive if I forget thy presence. Scipio,
  Thy face makes Massinissa more than man,
  And here before your steady power a vow
  As firm as fate I make: when I desist
  To be commanded by thy virtue, Scipio,
  Or fall from friend of Rome,[350] revenging gods
  Afflict me with[351] your torture. I have given
  Of passion and of faith, my heart.

  _Sci._ To counsel then;                                          40
  Grief fits weak hearts, revenging virtue men.
  Thus I think fit, before that Syphax know
  How deeply Carthage sinks, let's beat swift march
  Up even to Cirta, and whilst Syphax snores
  With his, late thine----

  _Mass._ With mine! no, Scipio;
  Libya hath poison, asps, knives, and too much earth
  To make one grave. With mine! Not; she can die.
  Scipio, with mine! Jove, say it, thou dost lie.

  _Sci._ Temperance be Scipio's honour.

  _L�._ Cease your strife,
  She is a woman.

  _Mass._ But she is my wife.                                      50

  _L�._ And yet she is no god.

  _Mass._ And yet she's more:
  I do not praise gods' goodness, but adore;
  Gods cannot fall, and for their constant goodness
  (Which is necessited) they have a crown
  Of never-ending pleasures; but faint man
  (Framed to have his weakness made the heavens' glory),
  If he with steady virtue holds all siege
  That power, that speech, that pleasure, that full sweets,
  A world of greatness can assail him with,
  Having no pay but self-wept misery,                              60
  A[352] beggar's treasure-heap,--that man I'll praise
  Above the gods.

  _Sci._ The Libyan speaks bold sense.

  _Mass._ By that by which all is, proportion,
  I speak with thought.

  _Sci._ No more.

  _Mass._ Forgive my admiration:
  You touch'd a string to which my sense was quick.
  Can you but think? Do, do; my grief--my grief--
  Would make a saint blaspheme! Give some relief;
  As thou art Scipio, forgive that I forget
  I am a soldier. Such woes Jove's ribs would burst:
  Few speak less ill that feel so much of worst.--                 70
  My ear attends.

  _Sci._ Before then Syphax join,
  With new-strength'd Carthage, or can once unwind
  His tangled sense from out so wild[353] amaze,
  Fall we like sudden lightning 'fore his eyes:
  Boldness and speed are all of victories.

  _Mass._ Scipio, let Massinissa clip thy knees!
  May once these eyes view Syphax? shall this arm
  Once make him feel his sin? O ye gods!
  My cause, my cause! Justice is so huge odds,
  That he who with it fears, heaven must renounce                  80
  In his creation.

  _Sci._ Beat then a close quick march!
  Before the morn shall shake cold dews through skies,
  Syphax shall tremble at Rome's thick alarms.

  _Mass._ Ye powers, I challenge conquest to just arms.

                     [_With a full flourish of cornets, they depart._


     [349] The text is corrupt.--"Sees _me_ thus" (_i.e._, see me

                            ACT IV.[354]


                              SCENE I.

                           _Near Cirta._

   _Enter_ SOPHONISBA _and_ ZANTHIA, _as out of a cave's mouth_.


  _So._ Where are we, Zanthia?

  _Zan._ Vangue said the cave
  Opened in Belos' forest.

  _So._ Lord, how sweet
  I scent the air! The huge long vault's close vein,
  What damps[355] it breath'd! In Belos' forest, say'st?
  Be valiant, Zanthia; how far's Utica
  From these most heavy shades?

  _Zan._ Ten easy leagues.

  _So._ There's Massinissa: my true Zanthia,
  Shall's venture nobly to escape, and touch
  My lord's just arms? Love's wings so nimbly[356] heave
  The body up, that, as our toes shall trip                        10
  Over the tender and obedient grass,
  Scarce any drop of dew is dash'd to ground.
  And see the willing shade of friendly night
  Makes safe our instant haste! Boldness and speed
  Make actions most impossible succeed.

  _Zan._ But, madam, know the forest hath no way
  But one to pass, the which holds strictest guard.

  _So._ Do not betray me, Zanthia.

  _Zan._ I, madam?

  _So._ No,
  I not mistrust thee, yet--but----

  _Zan._ Here you may                                              20
  Delay your time.

  _So._ Ay, Zanthia, delay,
  By which we may yet hope--yet hope--alas!
  How all benumb'd's my sense! Chance hath so often struck
  I scarce can feel. I should now curse the gods,
  Call on the furies, stamp the patient earth.
  Cleave my stretch'd cheeks with sound, speak from all sense,
  But loud and full of players' eloquence.
  No, no; what shall we eat?

  _Zan._ Madam, I'll search
  For some ripe nuts which autumn hath shook down
  From the unleaved hazel, then some cooler air                    30
  Shall lead me to a spring. Or I will try
  The courteous pale[357] of some poor foresters
  For milk.

  _So._ Do, Zanthia. O happiness

                                                     [_Exit_ ZANTHIA.

  Of those that know not pride or lust of city!
  There's no man bless'd but those that most men pity.
  O fortunate poor maids, that are not forced
  To wed for state, nor are for state divorced!
  Whom policy of kingdoms doth not marry,
  But pure affection makes to love or vary;
  You feel no love which you dare not to show,                     40
  Nor show a love which doth not truly grow!
  O you are surely bless�d of the sky!
  You live, that know not death before you die.

                [_Through the vaut's_[358] _mouth, in his nightgown,
                         torch in his hand_, SYPHAX _enters just
                         behind_ SOPHONISBA.

  You are----

  _Sy._ In Syphax' arms. Thing of false lip,
  What god shall now release thee?

  _So._ Art a man?

  _Sy._ Thy limbs shall feel. Despite thy virtue, know
  I'll thread thy richest pearl. This forest's deaf
  As is my lust. Night and the god of silence
  Swells my full pleasures; no more shalt thou delude
  My easy credence. Virgin of fair brow,                           50
  Well-featured creature, and our utmost wonder,
  Queen of our youthful bed, be proud.

                    [SYPHAX _setteth away his light, and prepareth to
                       embrace_ SOPHONISBA.

                                        I'll use thee.

                               [SOPHONISBA _snatcheth out her knife_.

  _So._ Look thee--view this--show but one strain of force,
  Bow but to seize this arm, and by myself,
  Or more, by Massinissa, this good steel
  Shall set my soul on wing. Thus, form'd gods, see,
  And, men with gods' worth, envy nought but me!

  _Sy._ Do, strike thy breast; know, being dead, I'll use,
  With highest lust of sense, thy senseless flesh,
  And even then thy vex�d soul shall see,                          60
  Without resistance, thy trunk prostitute
  Unto our appetite.

  _So._ I shame to make thee know
  How vile thou speakest; corruption then as much
  As thou shalt do; but frame unto thy lusts
  Imagination's utmost sin: Syphax,
  I speak all frightless, know I live or die
  To Massinissa; nor the force of fate
  Shall make me leave his love, or slake thy hate.
  I will speak no more.

  _Sy._ Thou hast amazed us: woman's forc�d use,                   70
  Like unripe fruits, no sooner got but waste;
  They have proportion, colour, but no taste.--
  [_Aside._] Think, Syphax.--Sophonisba, rest thine own.
  Our guard!

                          _Enter a guard._

  Creature of most astonishing virtue,
  If with fair usage, love, and passionate courtings,
  We may obtain the heaven of thy bed,
  We cease no suit; from other force be free:
  We dote not on thy body, but love thee.

  _So._ Wilt thou keep faith?

  _Sy._ By thee, and by that power                                 80
  By which thou art thus glorious, trust my vow.
  Our guard convey the royal'st excellence
  That ever was call'd woman to our palace:
  Observe her with strict care.

  _So._ Dread Syphax, speak!
  As thou art worthy, is not Zanthia false?

  _Sy._ To thee she is.

  _So._ As thou art then thyself,
  Let her not be.

  _Sy._ She is not!

                                        [_The guard seizeth_ ZANTHIA.

  _Za._ Thus most speed:
  When two foes are grown friends, partakers bleed.

  _Sy._ When plants must flourish, their manure must rot.

  _So._ Syphax, be recompensed, I hate thee not.                   90

                          [_Exeunt_ SOPHONISBA, ZANTHIA, _and guard_.

  _Sy._ A wasting flame feeds on my amorous blood,
  Which we must cool, or die. What way all power,
  All speech, full opportunity, can make,
  We have made fruitless trial. Infernal Jove,
  You resolute angels that delight in flames,
  To you, all-wonder-working spirits, I fly!
  Since heaven helps not, deepest hell we'll try
  Here in this desert, the great soul of charms,
  Dreadful Erictho lives, whose dismal brow
  Contemns all roofs or civil coverture.                          100
  Forsaken graves and tombs, the ghosts forced out,
  She joys to inhabit.
  A loathsome yellow leanness spreads her face,
  A heavy hell-like paleness loads her cheeks,
  Unknown to a clear heaven; but if dark winds
  Or thick black clouds drive back the blinded stars,
  When her deep magic makes forced heaven quake
  And thunder spite of Jove,--Erictho then
  From naked graves stalks out, heaves proud her head
  With long unkemb'd hair loaden, and strives to snatch           110
  The night's quick sulphur; then she bursts up tombs,
  From half-rot sear-cloths then she scrapes dry gums
  For her black rites; but when she finds a corpse
  But[359] newly graved, whose entrails are not turn'd
  To slimy filth, with greedy havock then
  She makes fierce spoil, and swells with wicked triumph
  To bury her lean knuckles in his eyes;
  Then doth she gnaw the pale and o'ergrown nails
  From his dry hand; but if she find some life
  Yet lurking close, she bites his gelid[360] lips,               120
  And, sticking her black tongue in his dry throat,
  She breathes dire murmurs, which enforce him bear
  Her baneful secrets to the spirits of horror.
  To her first sound the gods yield any harm,
  As trembling once to hear a second charm:
  She is----

     _Infernal music plays softly whilst_ ERICTHO _enters, and,
                     when she speaks, ceaseth_.

  _Eri._ Here, Syphax, here; quake not, for know
  I know thy thoughts: thou wouldst entreat our power
  Nice Sophonisba's passion to enforce
  To thy affection, be all full of Jove.[361]
  'Tis done, 'tis done; to us heaven, earth, sea, air,            130
  And Fate itself obeys; the beasts[362] of death,
  And all the terrors angry gods invented
  (T'afflict the ignorance of patient man),
  Tremble at us; the roll'd-up snake uncurls[363]
  His twisted knots at our affrighting voice.
  Are we incensed? the king of flames[364] grows pale,
  Lest he be chok'd with black and earthy fumes,
  Which our charms raise. Be joy'd, make proud thy lust:
  I do not pray you, gods; my breath's, "You must."

  _Sy._ Deep knowing spirit, mother of all high                   140
  Mysterious science, what may Syphax yield
  Worthy thy art, by which my soul's thus eased?
  The gods first made me live, but thou live pleased.

  _Eri._ Know then, our love, hard by the reverent[365] ruins
  Of a once glorious temple rear'd to Jove,
  Whose very rubbish (like the pitied fall
  Of virtue most unfortunate) yet bears
  A deathless majesty, though now quite rased,
  Hurl'd down by wrath and lust of impious kings,
  So that, where holy flamens wont to sing                        150
  Sweet hymns to heaven, there the daw and crow,
  The ill-voiced raven, and still-chattering pie,
  Send out ungrateful sounds and loathsome filth;
  Where statues and Jove's acts were vively limn'd[366]
  Boys with black coals draw the veil'd parts of nature,
  And lecherous actions of imagin'd lust;
  Where tombs and beauteous urns of well-dead men
  Stood in assur�d rest, the shepherd now
  Unloads his belly, corruption most abhorr'd
  Mingling itself with their renown�d ashes:                      160
  Ourself quakes at it!
  There once a charnel-house, now a vast cave,
  Over whose brow a pale and untrod grove
  Throws out her heavy shade, the mouth thick arms
  Of darksome yew (sun-proof) for ever choke;
  Within rests barren darkness; fruitless drought
  Pines in eternal night; the steam of hell
  Yields not so lazy air: there, that's my cell;
  From thence a charm, which Jove dare not hear twice,
  Shall force her to thy bed. But, Syphax, know,                  170
  Love is the highest rebel to our art:
  Therefore I charge thee, by the fear of all
  Which thou know'st dreadful, or more, by ourself,
  As with swift haste she passeth to thy bed,
  And easy to thy wishes yields, speak not one word,
  Nor dare, as thou dost fear thy loss of joys,
  T'admit one light, one light.

  _Sy._ As to my fate
  I yield my guidance.

  _Eri._ Then, when I shall force
  The air to music, and the shades of night
  To form sweet sounds, make proud thy raised delight:
  Meantime, behold, I go a charm to rear,                         181
  Whose potent sound will force ourself to fear.

  _Sy._ Whither is Syphax heaved? at length shall's joy
  Hopes more desired than heaven? Sweet labouring earth,
  Let heaven be unform'd with mighty charms;
  Let Sophonisba only fill these arms,
  Jove we'll not envy thee. Blood's appetite
  Is Syphax' god; my wisdom is my sense,
  Without[367] a man I hold no excellence.
  Give me long breath, young beds, and sickness' ease;
  For we hold firm, that's lawful which doth please.              191

                     _Infernal music, softly._

  _Hark! hark! now rise infernal tones,
    The deep-fetch'd groans
  Of labouring spirits that attend
  Erictho._
    _Erictho!_                                             [_within._
      _Now crack the trembling earth, and send
                      Shrieks that portend
  Affrightment to the gods which hear
  Erictho._                                                       200
      _Erictho!_                                           [_within._

        _A treble viol, a base lute, &c., play softly within
                            the canopy._

  Hark! hark! now softer melody strikes mute
  Disquiet Nature. O thou power of sound,
  How thou dost melt me! Hark! now even heaven
  Gives up his soul amongst us. Now's the time
  When greedy expectation strains mine eyes
  For their loved object; now Erictho will'd
  Prepare my appetite for love's strict gripes.
  O you dear founts of pleasure, blood, and beauty,
  Raise active Venus worth fruition                               210
  Of such provoking sweetness. Hark, she comes!

                _A short song to soft music above._

  Now nuptial hymns enforc�d spirits sing.
  Hark, Syphax, hark! Now hell and heaven rings.

                              CANTANT.

  With music spite of Phoebus. Peace! She comes!

      _Enter_ ERICTHO _in the shape of_ SOPHONISBA, _her face
             veiled, and hasteth in the bed of_ SYPHAX.

  Fury of blood's impatient! Erictho,
  'Bove thunder sit: to thee, egregious soul,
  Let all flesh bend. Sophonisba, thy flame
  But equal mine, and we'll joy such delight,
  That gods shall not admire, but even spite!

                            ACT V.[368]


                              SCENE I.

               _Bed-chamber in the palace of_ SYPHAX.

         SYPHAX _draws the curtains, and discovers_ ERICTHO
                         _lying with him_.


  _Eri._ Ha! ha! ha!

  _Sy._ Light, light!

  _Eri._ Ha! ha!

  _Sy._ Thou rotten scum of hell!
  O my abhorr�d heat! O loath'd delusion!

                           [_They leap out of the bed_; SYPHAX _takes
                                 him to his sword._

  _Eri._ Why! fool of kings, could thy weak soul imagine
  That 'tis within the grasp of heaven or hell
  To enforce love? Why, know love dotes the fates,
  Jove groans beneath his weight: mere[369] ignorant thing,
  Know we, Erictho, with a thirsty womb,                           10
  Have coveted full threescore suns for blood of kings.
  We that can make enraged Neptune toss
  His huge curl'd locks without one breath of wind;
  We that can make heaven slide from Atlas' shoulder;
  We, in the pride and height of covetous lust,
  Have wish'd with woman's greediness to fill
  Our longing arms with Syphax' well-strung limbs:
  And dost thou think, if philters or hell-charms
  Could have enforced thy use, we would have deigned[370]
  Brain sleights? No, no. Now are we full                          20
  Of our dear wishes. Thy proud heat, well wasted,
  Hath made our limbs grow young! Our love, farewell!
  Know he that would force love, thus seeks his hell.

                          [ERICTHO _slips into the ground, as_ SYPHAX
                             _offers his sword to her_.

  _Sy._ Can we yet breathe? Is any plagued like me?
  Are we--let's think--O now contempt, my hate
  To thee, thy thunder, sulphur, and scorn'd name!
  He whose life's loath'd, and he who breathes to curse
  His very being,[371] let him thus with me

                                       [SYPHAX _kneels at the altar_.

  Fall 'fore an altar, sacred to black powers,
  And thus dare heavens! O thou whose blasting flames
  Hurl barren droughts upon the patient earth,                     31
  And thou, gay god of riddles and strange tales,
  Hot-brain�d Phoebus, all add if you can
  Something unto my misery! if aught
  Of plagues lurk in your deep-trench'd brows,
  Which yet I know not,--let them fall like bolts,
  Which wrathful Jove drives strong into my bosom!
  If any chance of war, or news ill-voiced,
  Mischief unthought of lurk, come, give't us all,
  Heap curse on curse, we can no lower fall!                       40

                 [_Out of the altar the ghost of_ ASDRUBAL _ariseth_.

  _Asd._ Lower--lower!

  _Sy._ What damn'd air is form'd
  Into that shape? Speak, speak, we cannot quake!
  Our flesh knows not ignoble tremblings. Speak!
  We dare thy terror. Methinks hell and fate
  Should dread a soul with woes made desperate.

  _Asd._ Know me the spirit of great Asdrubal,
  Father to Sophonisba, whose bad heart
  Made justly most unfortunate; for know,
  I turn'd unfaithful, after that[372] the field
  Chanced to our loss, when of thy men there fell                  50
  Six thousand souls, next fight of Libyans ten.
  After which loss we unto Carthage flying,
  Th' enrag�d people cried their army fell
  Through my base treason. Straight my revengeful Furies[373]
  Makes them pursue me; I with resolute haste
  Made to the grave of all our ancestors,
  Where poisoned, hoped my bones should have long rest:
  But see, the violent multitude arrives,
  Tear down our monument, and me now dead
  Deny a grave; hurl us among the rocks                            60
  To staunch beasts' hunger; therefore thus ungraved
  I seek slow rest. Now dost thou know more woes,
  And more must feel. Mortals, O fear to slight
  Your gods and vows. Jove's arm is of dread might.

  _Sy._ Yet speak: shall I o'ercome approaching foes?

  _Asd._ Spirits of wrath know nothing but their woes.

                                                             [_Exit._

                          _Enter_ NUNTIUS.

  _Nun._ My liege, my liege,
  The scouts of Cirta bring intelligence
  Of sudden danger; full ten thousand horse,
  Fresh and well-rid, strong Massinissa leads,                     70
  As wings to Roman legions that march swift,
  Led by that man of conquest, Scipio.

  _Sy._ Scipio?

  _Nun._ Direct to Cirta.

                                         [_A march far off is heard._

  Hark! their march is heard even to the city.

  _Sy._ Help! our guard! my arms!
  Bid all our leaders march! beat thick alarms!
  I have seen things which thou wouldst quake to hear.
  Boldness and strength! the shame of slaves be fear.
  Up, heart, hold sword! though waves roll thee on shelf,
  Though fortune leave thee, leave not thou thyself!               81

                                                     [_Exit, arming._


     [368] In old eds. is the direction--"_A Base Lute and a Treble
     Violl play for the Act_."

     [369] "Mere ignorant"--utterly ignorant. Old eds. "_more_
     ignorant."

                             SCENE II.

                     _Neighbourhood of Cirta._

  _Enter two Pages, with targets and javelins_; L�LIUS _and_ JUGURTH,
     _with halberds_; SCIPIO _and_ MASSINISSA _armed; cornets
     sounding a march_.


  _Sci._ Stand!

  _Mass._ Give the word--Stand!

  _Sci._ Part the file!

  _Mass._ Give way!
  Scipio, by thy great name, but greater virtue,--
  By our eternal love, give me the chance
  Of this day's battle! Let not thy envied fame
  Vouchsafe t'oppose[374] the Roman legions
  Against one weakened Prince of Libya.
  This quarrel's mine--mine be the stroke of fight!
  Let us and Syphax hurl out well-forced darts
  Each unto other's breast. O (what should I say?)
  Thou beyond epithet, thou whom proud lords of fortune
  May even envy,--alas! my joy's so vast                           11
  Makes me seem lost,--let us thunder and lightning
  Strike from our brave arms! Look, look, seize that hill!
  Hark! he comes near. From thence discern us strike
  Fire worth Jove; mount up, and not repute
  Me very proud, though wondrous resolute.
  My cause, my cause is my bold heart'ning odds,
  That sevenfold shield; just arms should fright the gods.

  _Sci._ Thy words are full of honour; take thy fate.

  _Mass._ Which we do scorn to fear, to Scipio state               20
  Worthy his heart. Now let the forc�d brass
  Sound on!

        _Cornets sound a march._ SCIPIO _leads his train up
                           to the mount_.

  Jugurth, clasp sure our casque,
  Arm us with care; and Jugurth, if I fall
  Through this day's malice or our fathers' sins,
  If it in thy sword lie, break up my breast,
  And save my heart that never fell nor sued[375]
  To aught but Jove and Sophonisba. Sound,
  Stern heart'ners unto wounds and blood--sound loud,
  For we have nam�d Sophonisba!

                                              [_Cornets, a flourish._

                                 So!

                                         [_Cornets, a march far off._

  Hark, hark, he comes! stand blood! Now multiply                  31
  Force more than fury. Sound high, sound high, we strike
  For Sophonisba!

      _Enter_ SYPHAX, _arm'd, his Pages with shields and darts
                 before; cornets sounding marches_.

  _Sy._ For Sophonisba!

  _Mass._ Syphax!

  _Sy._ Massinissa!

  _Mass._ Betwixt us two,
  Let single fight try all.

  _Sy._ Well urged.

  _Mass._ Well granted.
  Of you, my stars, as I am worthy you,
  I implore aid; and O, if angels wait
  Upon good hearts, my genius be as strong
  As I am just.

  _Sy._ Kings' glory is their wrong.                               40
  He that may only do just acts 's a slave.
  My god's my arm;[376] my life my heaven; my grave
  To me all end.

  _Mass._ Give day, gods,--life, not death,--
  To him that only fears blaspheming breath.
  For Sophonisba!

  _Sy._ For Sophonisba!

  _Cornets sound a charge._ MASSINISSA _and_ SYPHAX _combat_. SYPHAX
      _falls_. MASSINISSA _unclasps_ SYPHAX' _casque, and is_[377]
      _about to kill him when_ SYPHAX _speaks_.

  _Sy._ Unto thy fortune, not to thee, we yield.

  _Mass._ Lives Sophonisba yet unstain'd, speak just--
  Yet ours unforced?

  _Sy._ Let my heart fall more low
  Than is my body, if only to thy glory                            50
  She lives not yet all thine.

  _Mass._ Rise, rise! Cease strife!
  Hear a most deep revenge--from us take life!

  _Cornets sound a march._ SCIPIO _and_ L�LIUS _enter_. SCIPIO
     _passeth to his throne_. MASSINISSA _presents_ SYPHAX _to_
     SCIPIO'S _feet, cornets sounding a flourish_.

  To you all power of strength; and next to thee,
  Thou spirit of triumph, born for victory,
  I heave these hands. March we to Cirta straight,
  My Sophonisba with swift haste to win,
  In honour and in love all mean is sin.

                                  [_Exeunt_ MASSINISSA _and_ JUGURTH.

  _Sci._ As we are Rome's great general, thus we press
  Thy captive neck. But as still Scipio,
  And sensible of just humanity,                                   60
  We weep thy bondage. Speak, thou ill-chanced man,
  What spirit took thee when thou wert our friend
  (Thy right hand given both to gods and us,
  With such most passionate vows and solemn faith),
  Thou fled'st with such most foul disloyalty
  To now weak Carthage? strengthening their bad arms,
  Who lately scorn'd thee with all loath'd abuse,
  Who never entertain for love but use?

  _Sy._ Scipio, my fortune is captived, not I,
  Therefore I'll speak bold truth; nor once mistrust               70
  What I shall say, for now, being wholly yours,
  I must not feign. Sophonisba, 'twas she,
  'Twas Sophonisba that solicited
  My forced revolt; 'twas her resistless suit,
  Her love to her dear Carthage, 'ticed me break
  All faith with men; 'twas she made Syphax false;
  She that loves Carthage with such violence,
  And hath such moving graces to allure,
  That she will turn a man that once hath sworn
  Himself on's father's bones her Carthage foe,                    80
  To be that city's champion and high friend.
  Her hymeneal torch burnt down my house;
  Then was I captived, when her wanton arms
  Threw[378] moving clasps about my neck. O charms,
  Able to turn even Fate! But this, in my true grief,
  Is some just joy, that my love-sotted foe
  Shall seize that plague; that Massinissa's breast
  Her hands shall arm, and that ere long you'll try
  She can force him your foe as well as I.

  _Sci._ L�lius, L�lius, take a choice troop of horse,             90
  And spur to Cirta. To Massinissa thus:
  Syphax' palace, crown's spoil, city's sack,
  Be free to him. But if our new-leagued[379] friend
  Possess that woman of so moving art,
  Charge him with no less weight than his dear vow,
  Our love, all faith, that he resign her thee;
  As he shall answer Rome, will him[380] give up
  A Roman prisoner to the Senate's doom:
  She is a Carthaginian. Now our law's[381]--
  Wise men prevent not actions, but ever cause.                   100

  _Sy._ Good Malice, so, as liberty so dear,
  Prove my revenge. What I cannot possess
  Another shall not--that's some happiness.

                                      [_Exeunt, cornets flourishing._

                             SCENE III.

                              _Cirta._

  _Cornets afar off sounding a charge. A soldier wounded at one door.
     Enter at the other_ SOPHONISBA, _two Pages before her with
     lights, two women bearing up her train_.


  _Sol._ Princess, O fly! Syphax hath lost the day,
  And captived lies. The Roman legions
  Have seiz'd the town, and with inveterate hate
  Make slaves, or murder all. Fire and steel,
  Fury and night, hold all. Fair Queen, O fly!
  We bleed for Carthage, all for[382] Carthage die!

                                                             [_Exit._

  _Cornets sounding a march. Enter Pages with javelins and targets._
     MASSINISSA _and_ JUGURTH; MASSINISSA'S _beaver shut_.

  _Mass._ March to the palace.

  _So._ Whate'er man thou art,
  Of Libya thy fair arms speak, give heart
  To amazed weakness; hear her, that for long time
  Hath seen no wish�d light. Sophonisba,                           10
  A name for misery much known, 'tis she
  Entreats of thy graced sword this only boon:--
  Let me not kneel to Rome; for though no cause
  Of mine deserves their hate, though Massinissa
  Be ours to heart, yet Roman generals
  Make proud their triumphs with whatever captives.
  O 'tis a nation which from soul I fear,
  As one well knowing the much-grounded hate
  They bear to Asdrubal and Carthage blood;
  Therefore with tears that wash thy feet, with hands              20
  Unused to beg, I clasp thy manly knees:
  O save me from their fetters and contempt,
  Their proud insults and more than insolence!
  Or, if it rest not in thy grace of breath
  To grant such freedom, give me long-wish'd death;
  For 'tis not now loath'd life that we do crave,--
  Only an unshamed death and silent grave,
  We will now deign to bend for.

  _Mass._ Rarity!

                                      [MASSINISSA _disarms his head_.

  By thee and this right hand, thou shalt live free!

  _So._ We cannot now be wretched.

  _Mass._ Stay the sword!                                          30
  Let slaughter cease; sounds soft as Leda's breast

                                                       [_Soft music._

  Slide through all ears. This night be love's high feast.

  _So._ O'erwhelm me not with sweets; let me not drink
  Till my breast burst, O Jove, thy nectar-skink.[383]

                               [_She sinks into_ MASSINISSA'S _arms_.

  _Mass._ She is o'ercome with joy!

  _So._ Help--help to bar[384]
  Some happiness, ye powers! I have joy to spare,
  Enough to make a god! O Massinissa!

  _Mass._ Peace!
  A silent thinking makes full joys increase!

                          _Enter_ L�LIUS.

  _L�._ Massinissa!

  _Mass._ L�lius!

  _L�._ Thine ear.

  _Mass._ Stand off.

  _L�._ From Scipio thus: by thy late vow of faith,                40
  And mutual league of endless amity,
  As thou respects his virtue, or Rome's force,
  Deliver Sophonisba to our hand.

  _Mass._ Sophonisba?

  _L�._ Sophonisba.

  _So._ My lord
  Looks pale, and from his half-burst eyes a flame
  Of deep disquiet breaks. The gods turn false
  My sad presage!

  _Mass._ Sophonisba?

  _L�._ Even she.

  _Mass._ She kill'd not Scipio's father, nor his uncle,
  Great Cneius.

  _L�._ Carthage did!

  _Mass._ To her what's Carthage?

  _L�._ Know 'twas her father Asdrubal strook[385] off             50
  His father's head. Give place to faith and fate!

  _Mass._ 'Tis cross to honour.

  _L�._ But 'tis just to state.
  So speaketh Scipio. Do not thou detain
  A Roman prisoner, due to this great triumph,
  As thou shalt answer Rome and him.

  _Mass._ L�lius,
  We now are in Rome's power. L�lius,
  View Massinissa do a loath�d act,
  Most sinking from that state his heart did keep.
  Look, L�lius, look, see Massinissa weep!
  Know I have made a vow, more dear to me                          60
  Than my soul's endless being, she shall rest
  Free from Rome's bondage!

  _L�._ But dost thou forget
  Thy vow, yet fresh, thus breath'd: _When I desist
  To be commanded by thy virtue, Scipio,
  Or fall from friend of Rome, revenging gods,
  Afflict me with your torture!_

  _Mass._ L�lius, enough.

  _L�._ Salute the Roman, tell him we will act
  What shall amaze him.

  _L�._ Wilt thou yield her then?

  _Mass._ She shall arrive there straight.

  _L�._ Best fate of men
  To thee.

  _Mass._ And Scipio.--Have I lived, O heavens,                    70

                                         [_Exit_ L�LIUS _with pages._

  To be enforcedly perfidious?

  _So._ What unjust grief afflicts my worthy lord?

  _Mass._ Thank me, ye gods, with much beholdingness;
  For mark, I do not curse you.

  _So._ Tell me, sweet,
  The cause of thy much anguish.

  _Mass._ Ha, the cause?
  Let's see: wreathe back thine arms, bend down thy neck,
  Practise base prayers, make fit thyself for bondage.

  _So._ Bondage!

  _Mass._ Bondage--Roman bondage!

  _So._ No, no!

  _Mass._ How then have I vow'd well to Scipio?

  _So._ How then to Sophonisba?

  _Mass._ Right, which way?                                        80
  Run mad!--impossible!--distraction!

  _So._ Dear lord, thy patience; let it maze all power,
  And list to her in whose sole heart it rests
  To keep thy faith upright.

  _Mass._ Wilt thou be slaved?

  _So._ No, free.

  _Mass._ How then keep I my faith?

  _So._ My death
  Gives help to all. From Rome so rest we free;
  So brought to Scipio, faith is kept in thee.

  _Mass._ Thou darest not die--some wine!--thou darest not die!

                _Enter a Page with a bowl of wine._

  _So._ How near was I unto the curse of man. Joy!
  How like was I yet once to have been glad!                       90
  He that ne'er laugh'd may with a constant face
  Contemn Jove's frown: happiness makes us base.

          [_She takes the bowl, into which_ MASSINISSA _puts poison_.

  Behold me, Massinissa, like thyself,
  A king and soldier; and I prithee keep
  My last command.

  _Mass._ Speak, sweet.

  _So._ Dear, do not weep.
  And now with undismay'd resolve behold,
  To save you--you (for honour and just faith
  Are most true gods, which we should much adore),
  With even disdainful vigour I give up
  An abhorr'd life. You have been good to me,                     100

                                                       [_She drinks._

  And I do thank thee, heaven! O my stars,
  I bless your goodness, that with breast unstain'd,
  Faith pure, a virgin wife, tried to my glory,
  I die, of female faith the long-lived story;
  Secure from bondage and all servile harms,
  But more--most happy in my husband's arms.

                                                        [_She sinks._

  _Ju._ Massinissa, Massinissa!

  _Mass._ Covetous,
  Fame-greedy lady, could no scope of glory,
  No reasonable proportion of goodness,
  Fill thy great breast, but thou must prove immense            110
  Incomprehence in virtue! What, wouldst thou
  Not only be admired, but even adored?
  O glory ripe for heaven! Sirs, help, help, help!
  Let us to Scipio with what speed you can;
  For piety make haste, whilst yet we are man.

                          [_Exeunt, bearing_ SOPHONISBA _in a chair_.

     [383] So ed. 2.--Ed. 1. "O Ioue thy Nectar, thinke."
     ("Nectar-skink"--draught of nectar.)

     [384] Old eds. "beare," but the sense clearly requires "bar"
     (pronounced "bear" to rhyme with "spare"). We have twice had the
     word "bar" spelt "beare" earlier in the present play.

                             SCENE IV.

                     _Neighbourhood of Cirta._

  _Cornets a march. Enter_ SCIPIO _in full state, triumphal ornaments
     carried before him, and_ SYPHAX _bound; at the other door_,
     L�LIUS.


  _Sci._ What answers Massinissa? Will he send
  That Sophonisba of so moving tongue?[386]

  _L�._ Full of dismay'd unsteadiness he stood,
  His right hand lock'd in hers, which hand he gave
  As pledge for Rome she[387] ever should live free.
  But when I enter'd and well urged this vow
  And thy command, his great heart sunk with shame,
  His eyes lost spirit, and his heat of life
  Sank from his face, as one that stood benumb'd,
  All mazed, t'effect impossibilities;                             10
  For either unto her or Scipio
  He must break vow. Long time he toss'd his thoughts;
  And as you see a snow-ball being roll'd,
  At first a handful, yet, long bowl'd about,
  Insensibly acquires a mighty globe,--
  So his cold grief through agitation grows,
  And more he thinks, the more of grief he knows.
  At last he seem'd to yield her.

  _Sy._ Mark, Scipio!
  Trust him that breaks a vow?

  _Sci._ How then trust thee?                                      19

  _Sy._ O, misdoubt him not, when he's thy slave like me.

                _Enter_ MASSINISSA, _all in black_.

  _Mass._ Scipio!

  _Sci._ Massinissa!

  _Mass._ General!

  _Sci._ King!

  _Mass._ Lives there no mercy for one soul of Carthage,
  But must see baseness?

  _Sci._ Wouldst thou joy thy peace,
  Deliver Sophonisba straight and cease;
  Do not grasp that which is too hot to hold.
  We grace thy grief, and hold it with soft sense;
  Enjoy good courage, but 'void insolence.
  I tell thee Rome and Scipio deign to bear
  So low a breast as for her say--we fear.

  _Mass._ Do not, do not; let not the fright of nations            30
  Know so vile terms. She rests at thy dispose.

  _Sy._ To my soul['s] joy. Shall Sophonisba then
  With me go bound, and wait on Scipio's wheel?
  When th' whole world's giddy, one man cannot reel.

  _Mass._ Starve thy lean hopes; and, Romans, now behold
  A sight would sad the gods, make Phoebus cold.

  _Organ and recorders play to a single voice. Enter in the meantime
     the mournful solemnity of_ MASSINISSA'S _presenting_ SOPHONISBA'S
     _body_.

  Look, Scipio, see what hard shift we make
  To keep our vows. Here, take, I yield her thee;
  And Sophonisba, I keep vow, thou'rt still free.

  _Sy._ Burst, my vex'd heart: the torture that most racks         40
  An enemy is his foe's royal acts.

  _Sci._ The glory of thy virtue live for ever;
  Brave hearts may be obscured, but extinct never.

                                         [SCIPIO _adorns_ MASSINISSA.

  Take from the general of Rome this crown,
  This robe of triumph, and this conquest's wreath,
  This sceptre and this hand; for ever breathe
  Rome's very minion. Live worth thy fame,
  As far from faintings as from now base name.

  _Mass._ Thou whom, like sparkling steel, the strokes of chance
  Made hard and firm, and, like[388] wild-fire turn'd,             50
  The more cold fate, the more thy virtue burn'd,
  And in whole seas of miseries didst flame;
  On thee, loved creature of a deathless fame,

                                     [MASSINISSA _adorns_ SOPHONISBA.

  Rest all my honour! O thou for whom I drink
  So deep of grief, that he must only think,
  Not dare to speak, that would express my woe;
  Small rivers murmur, deep gulfs silent flow.
  My grief is here,[389] not here: heave gently then,
  Women's right wonder, and just shame of men.

                                        [_Exeunt all but_ MASSINISSA.

                    _Cornets a short flourish._


     [386] Ed. 2. "tongues."

     [387] Ed. 1. "he."

     [388] Ed. 2. "like to wild fire." (As the line stands, "firm" is
     equivalent to a dissyllable.)

     [389] _i.e._, in my heart, not my eyes.




                             EPILOGUS.


  _Mass._ And[390] now
  With lighter passion, though with most just fear,
  I change my person, and do hither bear
  Another's voice, who with a phrase as weak
  As his deserts, now will'd me (thus form'd[391]) speak:
  If words well sensed, best suiting subject grave,
  Noble true story, may once boldly crave
  Acceptance gracious; if he whose fires
  Envy not others, nor himself admires;
  If scenes exempt from ribaldry or rage                           10
  Of taxings indiscreet, may please the stage;--
  If such may hope applause, he not commands,
  Yet craves as due the justice of your hands.
  But freely he protests, howe'er it is--
  Or well, or ill, or much, not much amiss--
  With constant modesty he does submit
  To all, save those that have more tongue than wit.[392]
