 _enter_ galeatzo piero alberto antonio forobosco balurdo matzagente 
_and_ feliche _with parts in their hands having cloaks cast over their 
apparel_. _gal._ come sirs come the music will sound straight for 
entrance. are ye ready are ye perfect _pier._ faith we can say our parts 
but we are ignorant in what mould we must cast our actors. _alb._ whom 
do you personate _pier._ piero duke of venice. _alb._ o ho then thus 
frame your exterior shape to haughty form of elate majesty as if you 
held the palsyshaking head of reeling chance under your fortunes belt in 
strictest vassalage: grow big in thought as swoln with glory of 
successful arms. _pier._ if that be all fear not ill suit it right. who 
cannot be proud stroke up the hair and strut _alb._ truth such rank 
custom is grown popular and now the vulgar fashion strides as wide and 
stalks as proud upon the weakest stilts of the slightst fortunes as if 
hercules or burly atlas shoulderd up their state. _pier._ good: but whom 
act you _alb._ the necessity of the play forceth me to act two parts: 
andrugio the distressed duke of genoa and alberto a venetian gentleman 
enamoured on the lady rossaline whose fortunes being too weak to sustain 
the port of her he proved always disastrous in love his worth being much 
underpoised by the uneven scale that currents all things by the outward 
stamp of opinion. _gal._ well and what dost thou play _bal._ the part of 
all the world. _alb._ the part of all the world whats that _bal._ the 
fool. ay in good deed law now i play balurdo a wealthy mountbanking 
burgomascos heir of venice. _alb._ ha ha one whose foppish nature might 
seem great only for wise mens recreation and like a juiceless bark to 
preserve the sap of more strenuous spirits. a servile hound that loves 
the scent of forerunning fashion like an empty hollow vault still giving 
an echo to wit: greedily champing what any other well valued judgment 
had beforehand chewd. _foro._ ha ha ha tolerably good good faith sweet 
wag. _alb._ umph why tolerably good good faith sweet wag go go you 
flatter me. _foro._ right i but dispose my speech to the habit of my 
part. _alb._ why what plays he _to_ feliche. _feli._ the wolf that eats 
into the breasts of princes that breeds the lethargy and falling 
sickness in honour makes justice look asquint and blinds the eye of 
merited reward from viewing desertful virtue. _alb._ whats all this 
periphrasis ha _feli._ the substance of a supplechapt flatterer. _alb._ 
o doth he play forobosco the parasite good ifaith. sirrah you must seem 
now as glib and straight in outward semblance as a ladys busk though 
inwardly as cross as a pair of tailors legs having a tongue as nimble as 
his needle with servile patches of glavering flattery to stitch up the 
bracks of unworthily honourd _foro._ i warrant you i warrant you you 
shall see me prove the very periwig to cover the bald pate of brainless 
gentility. ho i will so tickle the sense of _bella gratiosa madonna_ 
with the titillation of hyperbolical praise that ill strike it in the 
nick in the very nick chuck. _feli._ thou promisest more than i hope any 
spectator gives faith of performance but why look you so dusky ha _to_ 
antonio. _ant._ i was never worse fitted since the nativity of my 
actorship i shall be hissd at on my life now. _feli._ why what must you 
play _ant._ faith i know not what an hermaphrodite two parts in one my 
true person being antonio son to the duke of genoa though for the love 
of mellida pieros daughter i take this feigned presence of an amazon 
calling myself florizell and i know not what. i a voice to play a lady i 
shall neer do it. _alb._ o an amazon should have such a voice 
viragolike. not play two parts in one away away tis common fashion. nay 
if you cannot bear two subtle fronts under one hood idiot go by go by 
off this worlds stage o times impurity _ant._ ay but when use hath 
taught me action to hit the right point of a ladys part i shall grow 
ignorant when i must turn young prince again how but to truss my hose. 
_feli._ tush never put them off for women wear the breeches still. 
_mat._ by the bright honour of a milanoise and the resplendent fulgor of 
this steel i will defend the feminine to death and ding his spirit to 
the verge of hell that dares divulge a ladys prejudice _exeunt_ 
matzagente forobosco _and_ balurdo. _feli._ rampum scrampum mount tufty 
tamburlaine what rattling thunderclap breaks from his lips _alb._ o tis 
native to his part. for acting a modern braggadoch under the person of 
matzagente the duke of milans son it may seem to suit with good fashion 
of coherence. _pier._ but methinks he speaks with a spruce attic accent 
of adulterate spanish. _alb._ so tis resolvd. for milan being half 
spanish half high dutch and half italians the blood of chiefest houses 
is corrupt and mongreld so that you shall see a fellow vainglorious for 
a spaniard gluttonous for a dutchman proud for an italian and a 
fantastic idiot for all. such a one conceit this matzagente. _feli._ but 
i have a part allotted me which i have neither able apprehension to 
conceit nor what i conceit gracious ability to utter. _gal._ whoop in 
the old cut good show us a draught of thy spirit. _feli._ tis steady and 
must seem so impregnably fortressed with his own content that no envious 
thought could ever invade his spirit never surveying any man so 
unmeasuredly happy whom i thought not justly hateful for some true 
impoverishment never beholding any favour of madam felicity gracing 
another which his wellbounded content persuaded not to hang in the front 
of his own fortune and therefore as far from envying any man as he 
valued all men infinitely distant from accomplished beatitude. these 
native adjuncts appropriate to me the name of feliche. but last good thy 
humour. _exeunt_ piero alberto _and_ galeatzo. _ant._ tis to be 
described by signs and tokens. for unless i were possessed with a legion 
of spirits tis impossible to be made perspicuous by any utterance: for 
sometimes he must take austere state as for the person of galeatzo the 
son of the duke of florence and possess his exterior presence with a 
formal majesty: keep popularity in distance and on the sudden fling his 
honour so prodigally into a common arm that he may seem to give up his 
indiscretion to the mercy of vulgar censure. now as solemn as a 
traveller and as grave as a puritans ruff with the same breath as slight 
and scattered in his fashion as a a anything now as sweet and neat as a 
barbers castingbottle straight as slovenly as the yeasty breast of an 
aleknight: now lamenting then chafing straight laughing then . _feli._ 
what then _ant._ faith i know not what t had been a right part for 
proteus or gew. ho blind gew would ha done t rarely rarely. _feli._ i 
fear it is not possible to limn so many persons in so small a tablet as 
the compass of our plays afford. _ant._ right therefore i have heard 
that those persons as he and you feliche that are but slightly drawn in 
this comedy should receive more exact accomplishment in a second part 
which if this obtain gracious acceptance means to try his fortune. 
_feli._ peace here comes the prologue: clear the stage. _exeunt._ we 
have an induction before _what you will_ and _the malcontent_. ben 
jonson was particularly fond of introducing preliminary dialogues which 
are usually so tedious that we are fain to exclaim with cordatus in the 
induction to _every man out of his humour_ i would they would begin once 
this protraction is able to sour the best settled patience in the 
theatre. _i.e._ the poverty of the theatrical company. it was common for 
an actor to represent two characters or more in the same play. for 
example william shurlock personated maharbal and prusias in nabbes 
_hannibal and scipio_ and in the same play hugh clerke besides taking 
the part of syphax personated the nuntius. old eds. shewd. so ed. . the 
to gives blinks. a piece of whalebone steel or wood worn down the front 
of the stays to keep them straight. rents cracks. truss my hose tie the 
tagged laces of my breeches. hurl violently. old eds. _exeunt_ ant. 
_and_ alb. common worthless. the use of modern in this sense is 
frequently found and was sanctioned by shakespeare but it did not escape 
ben jonsons censure in _the poetaster_ v. i.: alas that were no _modern_ 
consequence to have cothurnal buskins frightened hence. the old cut the 
old fashion. so nashe in the epistle dedicatory prefixed to _strange 
news of the intercepting certain letters_ : you are amongst grave 
doctors and men of judgment in both laws every day. i pray ask them the 
question in my absence whether such a man as i have described this 
epistler to be ... that hath made many proper rhymes of the _old cut_ in 
his days c. old eds. _exit_ alb. jaques in _as you like it_ describing 
his own melancholy says it is extracted from many objects and that the 
contemplation of his travels often wraps him in a most humorous sadness: 
on which rosalind observes a traveller by my faith you have great reason 
to be sad _dilke._ the puritans short starched ruffs were constantly 
ridiculed. see middletons _works_ viii. . a bottle for sprinkling 
perfumes. probably an actor who had gone blind but i can find no 
information about him. the prologue. the wreath of pleasure and 
delicious sweets begirt the gentle front of this fair troop select and 
most respected auditors for wits sake do not dream of miracles. alas we 
shall but falter if you lay the least sad weight of an unusd hope upon 
our weakness only we give up the worthless present of slight idleness to 
your authentic censure. o that our muse had those abstruse and sinewy 
faculties that with a strain of fresh invention she might press out the 
rarity of art the purst elixd juice of rich conceit in your attentive 
ears that with the lip of gracious elocution we might drink a sound 
carouse into your health of wit. but o the heavy dryness of her brain 
foil to your fertile spirits is ashamd to breathe her blushing numbers 
to such ears. yet most ingenious deign to veil our wants with sleek 
acceptance polish these rude scenes and if our slightness your large 
hope beguiles check not with bended brow but dimpled smiles. _exit_ 
prologue. so ed. . ed. heathy. the first part of antonio and mellida.

blood veins sinews arteries why crack ye not burst and divulst with 
anguish of my grief can man by no means creep out of himself and leave 
the slough of viperous grief behind antonio hast thou seen a fight at 
sea as horrid as the hideous day of doom betwixt thy father duke of 
genoa and proud piero the venetian prince: in which the sea hath swoln 
with genoas blood and made springtides with the warm reeking gore that 
gushd from out our galleys scupperholes in which thy father poor 
andrugio lies sunk or leapd into the arms of chance choked with the 
labouring oceans brackish foam who even despite pieros cankerd hate 
would with an armd hand have seized thy love and linkd thee to the 
beauteous mellida. have i outlived the death of all these hopes have i 
felt anguish pourd into my heart burning like balsamum in tender wounds 
and yet dost live could not the fretting sea have rolld me up in 
wrinkles of his brow is death grown coy or grim confusion nice that it 
will not accompany a wretch but i must needs be cast on venice shore and 
try new fortunes with this strange disguise to purchase my adord mellida

hurleth my glory bout this ball of earth whilst the venetian duke is 
heavd up on wings of fair success to overlook the lowcast ruins of his 
enemies to see myself adored and genoa quake my fate is firmer than 
mischance can shake. _feli._ stand the ground trembleth. _pier._ ha an

most gracious. _pier._ are proclamations sent through italy that 
whosoever brings andrugios head or young antonios shall be guerdond with 
twenty thousand double pistolets and be endeard to pieros love _foro._ 
they are sent every way: sound policy sweet lord. _feli._ _aside._

not a whit good fair lets have it all: i love not i to have a jot left 
out if the tale come from a loved orator. _ant._ vouchsafe me then your 
hushd observances. vehement in pursuit of strange novelties after long 
travel through the asian main i shippd my hopeful thoughts for brittany 
longing to view great natures miracle the glory of our sex whose fame 
doth strike remotest ears with adoration. sailing some two months with 
inconstant winds we viewd the glistering venetian forts to which we 
made: when lo some three leagues off we might descry a horrid spectacle 
the issue of black fury strewd the sea with tatterd carcasses of 
splitted ships half sinking burning floating topsyturvy. not far from 
these sad ruins of fell rage we might behold a creature press the waves 
senseless he sprawld all notchd with gaping wounds. to him we made and 
short we took him up the first thing he spake was mellida and then he 
swooned. _mel._ ay me _ant._ why sigh you fair _mel._ nothing but little 
humours good sweet on. _ant._ his wounds being dressd and life recoverd 
we gan discourse when lo the sea grew mad his bowels rumbling with 
windpassion straight swarthy darkness poppd out phoebus eye and blurrd 
the jocund face of brightcheekd day whilst crudled fogs masked even 
darkness brow: heaven bads good night and the rocks groand at the 
intestine uproar of the main. now gusty flaws strook up the very heels 
of our mainmast whilst the keen lightning shot through the black bowels 
of the quaking air straight chops a wave and in his sliftred paunch down 
falls our ship and there he breaks his neck which in an instant up was 
belkt again. when thus this martyrd soul began to sigh: give me your 
hand quoth he: now do you grasp th unequalld mirror of raggd misery: ist 
not a horrid storm o wellshaped sweet could your quick eye strike 
through these gashd wounds you should behold a heart a heart fair 
creature raging more wild than is this frantic sea. wolt do me a favour 
if thou chance survive but visit venice kiss the precious white of my 
most nay all epithets are base to attribute to gracious mellida: tell 
her the spirit of antonio wisheth his last gasp breathd upon her breast. 
_ros._ why weeps softhearted florizell _ant._ alas the flinty rocks 
groand at his plaints. tell her quoth he that her obdurate sire hath 
crackd his bosom therewithal he wept and thus sighd on: the sea is 
merciful look how it gapes to bury all my grief well thou shalt have it 
thou shalt be his tomb: my faith in my love live in thee die woe die 
unmatchd anguish die antonio with that he totterd from the reeling deck 
and down he sunk. _ros._ pleasures body what makes my lady weep _mel._ 
nothing sweet rossaline but the airs sharp my fathers palace madam will 
be proud to entertain your presence if youll deign to make repose 
within. ay me _ant._ lady our fashion is not curious. _ros._ faith all 
the nobler tis more generous. _mel._ shall i then know how fortune fell 
at last what succour came or what strange fate ensued _ant._ most 
willingly: but this same court is vast and public to the staring

gallants throws his cloak upon the table salutes the gentlemen and 
presently calls for a cup of canary. george had a pair of hose on that 
for some offence durst not to be seen in that hue they were first dyed 
in but from his first colour being a youthful green his long age turned 
him into a mournful black and for his antiquity was in print. which this 
busybody perceiving thought now to give it him to the quick and drawing 
near master peele looking upon his breeches by my troth sir quoth she 
these are exceedingly well printed. at which word george being a little 
moved in his mind that his old hose were called in question answered and

desert and hear mens plaints that when a soul is splitted sunk with 
grief he might fall thus upon the breast of earth _he throws himself on 
the ground._ exclaiming thus: o thou allbearing earth which men do gape 
for till thou crammst their mouths and chokest their throats with dust o 
chaune thy breast and let me sink into thee look who knocks andrugio 
calls. but o shes deaf and blind: a wretch but lean relief on earth can

of the tumbling sea we are rolld up upon the venice marsh lets clip all 
fortune lest more lowring fate _and._ more lowring fate o lucio choke 
that breath. now i defy chance: fortunes brow hath frownd even to the 
utmost wrinkle it can bend: her venoms spit. alas what country rests 
what son what comfort that she can deprive triumphs not venice in my 
overthrow gapes not my native country for my blood lies not my son tombd 
in the swelling main and yet more lowring fate theres nothing left unto 
andrugio but andrugio: and that nor mischief force distress nor hell can

kind of royal impatience a turbulent greatness an affected resignation. 
the enemies which he enters lists to combat despair and mighty grief and 
sharp impatience and the forces cornets of horse c. which he brings to 
vanquish them are in the boldest style of allegory. they are such a race 
of mourners as the infection of sorrows loud in the intellect might 
beget on some pregnant cloud in the imagination. _charles lamb._ scene

vol. ix. p. points out that erasmus has the same simile: anima qu 
moderatur utrumque corpus animantis improprie dicitur anima cum revera 
sint anim reliqui non aliter quam odor rosarum manet in manu etiam rosa 
sublata. _colloq._ leyden ed. i. . old ed. holds. these ravings are 
unintelligible. the stagedirection in the old eds. is _enter andrugio 
lucio cole and norwood._ i suppose that cole and norwood are the names 
of the actors who personated andrugio and lucio. give me assay taste it 
before i drink. the _assayer_ in courts and baronial halls was the 
officer who tasted the dishes before the banquet in order to make sure 
that no poison was concealed. old eds. _made open_ the glibbery ice 
which modern editors absurdly retain. the word glibbery has been already 
noticed note p. . cf. _julius csar_ i. text of first folio: and then he 
offered it the third time hee put it the third time by and still as hee 
refusd it the rabblement _howted_ and clappd their chopt hands. in that 
passage the first three folios give _howted_ and the fourth _houted_ but 
modern editors reject the word and read either _hooted_ or _shouted_. 
the present passage of marston affords strong warrant for restoring the 
reading of the folios. _hout_ is clearly an onomatopoeic word like 
_hoit_: he sings and _hoits_ and revels among his drunken companions 
_knight of the burning pestle_. old eds. last and so modern editors. old 
eds. _misereri_. antonio is concealed behind a bush. so ed. . ed. on. 
old eds. _suamisce_. dilke reads _smarisce_. old eds. _murono_. old eds. 
_pol._ so dilke. old eds. _bassiammi_. old eds. _che in sua neggia in 
quello_ c. old eds. repeat the word kissing. in good sadness seriously. 
tweer or twire peep pry. the dun cow is we all know intimately connected 
with the celebrated guy earl of warwick and i believe his kettle is one 
of the pretended relics still shown there. from the text i conjecture 
that the dun cow with the kettle on her head was in the time of marston 
a wellknown sign. _dilke._ omitted in ed. . old eds. _ant._ old eds. 
_and._ it is hard for andrugio to escape detection even when he is 
unarmed but if he puts on his armour he will be at once recognised. cf.

_the second part of the history of antonio and mellida._ _antonios 
reuenge. the second part. as it hath beene sundry times acted by the 
children of paules. written by i. m. london. printed for thomas fisher 
and are to be soulde in saint dunstans churchyarde._ . to. story of the 
play. piero had been a suitor for the hand of maria daughter of the duke 
of ferrara but his addresses had been rejected and maria had married 
andrugio the offspring of the union being antonio. when piero 
dissembling his hatred affects to be reconciled to andrugio lucio is 
despatched to bring maria to the venetian court. piero at a banquet 
given on the eve of his daughters marriage with antonio instils in 
andrugios cup a poison which has no immediate effect but works fatally 
after a few hours. with the help of a base creature strotzo he proceeds 
in the night to murder antonios friend feliche whose body is carried by 
strotzo to mellidas chamber. at sunrise maria and lucio arrive at 
venice. antonio whose sleep has been troubled by hideous dreams is 
abroad early and is met by his mother as he paces disquietly in front of 
mellidas chamber. presently the windowcurtain is drawn aside and there 
is exposed the body of feliche stabbed thick with wounds. while antonio 
is distractedly calling upon mellida to rise piero advances and 
proclaims himself the author of feliches death protesting that he had 
found his daughter in the embraces of the murdered man. the scene of 
confusion is heightened by the entrance of strotzo who announces that 
andrugio has died from excess of joy at his sudden change of fortunes. 
mellida is put in close confinement and a day is appointed for her 
trial. strotzo is instructed by piero to come forward at the trial and 
accuse antonio of having instigated the murders of andrugio and feliche. 
but before the trial andrugios ghost appears to antonio discloses pieros 
villainy and bids antonio take vengeance on the murderer. antonio stabs 
pieros young son julio at andrugios shrine he then disguises himself as 
marias fool and watches his opportunity for further vengeance. the trial 
of mellida is held: strotzo enters the court with a cord round his neck 
declaring that he had been suborned by antonio to commit the crimes and 
officers are despatched to arrest antonio who in his fools habit is 
watching the proceedings. it had been part of the plot that strotzo 
after making his confession should break into passionate outbursts of 
sorrow and implore piero to rid him of a dishonourable life whereupon 
piero was to spring forward grasp the cord round strotzos neck as with 
intent to strangle him then suddenly to relax his hold moved by strotzos 
penitent conduct. strotzo goes through his part of the performance but 
piero grasping one end of the cord while castilio a courtier grasps the 
other is careful not to loose his hold before the victim is strangled. 
presently word is brought that antonio in a fit of distraction has flung 
himself from a high tower into the sea. at this news mellida falls into 
a deep swoon and is conveyed to her chamber whither antonio after a 
short delay contrives to follow her but arrives only in time to see her 
expire. piero notwithstanding his daughters untoward death determines 
that his marriage with maria who affects to acquiesce in the arrangement 
shall take place without delay. a scheme of vengeance is contrived 
between antonio pandulfo feliches father and alberto feliches friend. 
the conspirators attire themselves as maskers and appear at a banquet 
given by piero on the eve of his marriage. on the appearance of the 
maskers piero enquires for his son julio and sends an attendant to fetch 
him to see the dances. after dancing a measure the maskers request piero 
to have the hall cleared while they sit unmasked at the banquet. 
thereupon the guests and retainers withdraw but piero at the maskers 
request remains. he takes a seat at the banquet the conspirators 
unmasking themselves spring forward and bind him with cords to the chair 
insult over him cut out his tongue produce in a dish the limbs of his 
murdered son and finally hack him to death with their swords. the 
tyrants death is welcomed with universal joy. the conspirators are 
hailed as saviours of their country and are offered high offices of 
state but prefer to spend the rest of their lives in the seclusion of a 
religious house. the prologue. the rawish dank of clumsy winter ramps 
the fluent summers vein and drizzling sleet chilleth the wan bleak cheek 
of the numbd earth whilst snarling gusts nibble the juiceless leaves 
from the nakd shuddring branch and pills the skin from off the soft and 
delicate aspects. o now methinks a sullen tragic scene would suit the 
time with pleasing congruence. may we be happy in our weak devoir and 
all part pleasd in most wishd content but sweat of hercules can neer 
beget so blest an issue. therefore we proclaim if any spirit breathes 
within this round uncapable of weighty passion as from his birth being 
huggd in the arms and nuzzled twixt the breasts of happiness who winks 
and shuts his apprehension up from common sense of what men were and are 
who would not know what men must be let such hurry amain from our 
blackvisaged shows: we shall affright their eyes. but if a breast naild 
to the earth with grief if any heart piercd through with anguish pant 
within this ring if there be any blood whose heat is choked and stifled 
with true sense of misery if ought of these strains fill this consort up 
th arrive most welcome. o that our power could lackey or keep wing with 
our desires that with unusd paize of style and sense we might weigh 
massy in judicious scale. yet heres the prop that doth support our 
hopes: when our scenes falter or invention halts your favour will give 
crutches to our faults. _exit._ act i. scene i. _a corridor in the

horrid dreams: three parts of night were swallowd in the gulf of 
ravenous time when to my slumbring powers two meagre ghosts made 
apparition. the ones breast seemd fresh paunchd with bleeding wounds 
whose bubbling gore sprang in my frighted eyes the other ghost assumd my 
fathers shape: both cried revenge at which my trembling joints icd quite 
over with a frozed cold sweat leapd forth the sheets. three times i 
graspd at shades and thrice deluded by erroneous sense i forcd my 
thoughts make stand when lo i oped a large bay window thorough which the 
night struck terror to my soul. the verge of heaven was ringd with 
flames and all the upper vault thicklacd with flakes of fire in midst 
whereof a blazing comet shot his threatning train just on my face. 
viewing these prodigies i bowd my naked knee and piercd the star with an 
outfacing eye pronouncing thus: _deus imperat astris_. at which my nose 
straight bled then doubted i my word so slunk to bed. _bal._ verily sir 
jeffrey had a monstrous strange dream the last night. for methought i 
dreamt i was asleep and methought the ground yawnd and belkt up the 
abhominable ghost of a misshapen simile with two ugly pages the one 
called master even as going before and the other mounser even so 
following after whilst signior simile stalkd most prodigiously in the 
midst. at which i bewrayd the fearfulness of my nature and being ready 
to forsake the fortress of my wit start up called for a clean shirt ate 
a mess of broth and with that i awaked. _ant._ i prithee peace. i tell

be spent thrice blessd soul that dieth innocent. if he is leperd with so 
foul a guilt why should a sigh be lent a tear be spilt the gripe of 
chance is weak to wring a tear from him that knows what fortitude should 
bear. listen young blood. tis not true valours pride to swagger quarrel 
swear stamp rave and chide to stab in fume of blood to keep loud coils 
to bandy factions in domestic broils to dare the act of sins whose filth 
excels the blackest customs of blind infidels. no my lovd youth: he may 
of valour vaunt whom fortunes loudest thunder cannot daunt whom fretful 
gales of chance stern fortunes siege makes not his reason slink the

what dost thou with a beard _bal._ in truth one told me that my wit was 
bald and that a mermaid was half fish and half fish _sic_ and therefore 
to speak wisely like one of your counsel as indeed it hath pleased you 
to make me not only being a fool of your counsel but also to make me of 
your counsel being a fool: if my wit be bald and a mermaid be half fish 
and half conger then i must be forced to conclude the tiring man hath 
not glued on my beard half fast enough. gods bores it will not stick to 
fall off. _pier._ dost thou know what thou hast spoken all this while 
_bal._ o lord duke i would be sorry of that. many men can utter that 
which no man but themselves can conceive: but i thank a good wit i have 
the gift to speak that which neither any man else nor myself 
understands. _pier._ thou art wise. he that speaks he knows not what 
shall never sin against his own conscience: go to thou art wise. _bal._ 
wise o no i have a little natural discretion or so but for wise i am 
somewhat prudent but for wise o lord _pier._ hold take those keys open

i pray his body. who less boon can crave than to bestow upon the dead 
his grave _pier._ grave why thinkst thou he deserves a grave that hath 
defild the temple of _pan._ peace peace methinks i hear a humming murmur 
creep from out his jellied wounds. look on those lips those now lawn 
pillows on whose tender softness chaste modest speech stealing from out 
his breast had wont to rest itself as loath to post from out so fair an

_pier._ thinkst thou thy son could suffer wrongfully _pan._ a wise man 
wrongfully but never wrong can take his breasts of such welltempered 
proof it may be razed not pierced by savage tooth of foaming malice: 
showers of darts may dark heavens ample brow but not strike out a spark 
much less pierce the suns cheek. such songs as these i often dittied

_aside._ fore heaven he makes me shrug would a were dead. he is a 
virtuous man: what has our court to do with virtue in the devils name 
pandulpho hark: my lustful daughter dies start not she dies. i pursue

whom he gave life hath given death for life. _aside_. how could he come 
on i see false suspect is viced wrung hardly in a virtuous heart. well i 
could give you reason for my doubts: you are of honourd birth my very 
friend: you know how godlike tis to root out sin. antonio is a villain: 
will you join in oath with me against the traitors life and swear you 
knew he sought his fathers death i loved him well yet i love justice 
more: our friends we should affect justice adore. _pan._ my lord the 
clapper of my mouths not glibbd with courtoil twill not strike on both 
sides yet. _pier._ tis just that subjects act commands of kings. _pan._ 
command then just and honourable things. _pier._ even so myself then 
will traduce his guilt. _pan._ beware take heed lest guiltless blood be 
spilt. _pier._ where only honest deeds to kings are free it is no empire 
but a beggary. _pan._ where more than noble deeds to kings are free it 
is no empire but a tyranny. _pier._ tush juiceless graybeard tis 
immunity proper to princes that our state exacts our subjects not alone 
to bear but praise our acts. _pan._ o but that prince that worthful 
praise aspires from hearts and not from lips applause desires. _pier._ 
pish true praise the brow of common men doth ring false only girts the 
temple of a king. he that hath strength and s ignorant of power he was 
not made to rule but to be ruld. _pan._ tis praise to do not what we can 
but should. _pier._ hence doting stoic by my hope of bliss ill make thee 
wretched. _pan._ defiance to thy power thou rifted jawn now by the lovd 
heaven sooner thou shalt rinse thy foul ribs from the black filth of sin 
that soots thy heart than make me wretched. pish thou canst not coop me 
up. hadst thou a jail with treble walls like antique babylon pandulpho 
can get out. i tell thee duke i have old fortunatus wishingcap and can 
be where i list even in a trice. ill skip from earth into the arms of 
heaven: and from triumphal arch of blessedness spit on thy frothy 
breast. thou canst not slave or banish me i will be free at home maugre 
the beard of greatness. the portholes of sheathd spirit are neer corbd 
up but still stand open ready to discharge their precious shot into the 
shrouds of heaven. _pier._ o torture slave i banish thee the town thy 
native seat of birth. _pan._ how proud thou speakst i tell thee duke the 
blasts of the swollncheekd winds nor all the breath of kings can puff me 
out my native seat of birth. the earths my bodys and the heavens my 
souls most native place of birth which they will keep despite the menace 
of mortality. why duke thats not my native place where i was rockd. a 
wise mans home is wheresoeer he is wise now that from man not from the 
place doth rise. _pier._ would i were deaf o plague hence dotard wretch 
tread not in court: all that thou hast i seize. _aside._ his quiets 
firmer than i can disease. _pan._ go boast unto thy flattring sycophants 
pandulphos slave piero hath oerthrown: loose fortunes rags are lost my

has perished by treachery. _fetch_ plot device. there is an attic 
flavour in this passage of _stichomythia_. for a passing moment one is 
reminded of creons altercation with his son in the _antigone_: kr.

then patn. marston uses indifferently the forms _chawn_ and _jawn_ for a 
rift or chasm. corbd old eds. corbd is good as polonius would say but i 
have no suspicion as to its meaning. it would be a pity to suggest an 
emendation. seneca is fond of harping on this theme. in ultimas 
expellaris terras licebit he writes in one of his epistles in quolibet 
barbari angulo colloceris hospitalis tibi illa qualiscumque sedes erit 
magis quis veneris quam quo interest et ideo nulli loco addicere debemus 
arbitrium. cum hac persuasione vivendum est: non sum uni angulo natus 
patria mea totus hic mundus est. scene ii. _before the palace of_ piero.

wretched are infected with but the most griefful most despairing

adulterous luxury i cannot brookt. i tell thee lucio sooner will i give 
faith that virtues cant in princes courts will be adornd with wreath of 
choice respect and endeard intimate sooner will i believe that 
friendships rein will curb ambition from utility than mellida is light. 
alas poor soul didst eer see her good heart hast heard her speak kind 
kind soul incredulity itself would not be so brasshearted as suspect so

giovanni altofronto duke of genoa driven from power by the plots of 
pietro jacomo disguises himself and lives under the name of malevole at 
the usurpers court assuming the character of a malcontent. his identity 
is known only to his faithful friend celso. a crafty courtier mendoza 
who had assisted in dethroning altofronto has adulterous intercourse 
with pietros wife aurelia. malevole exposes the intrigue to pietro but 
meanwhile aurelia induced by an old procuress maquerelle to believe that 
her lover is faithless discards mendoza and engages in an intrigue with 
another courtier ferneze. pietro sword in hand seeks mendoza who makes 
passionate protestations of his own innocence and declares that the 
guilty person is ferneze. on that very night ferneze has an appointment 
with the duchess and it is agreed that pietro with some of the guard 
shall break into the duchess chamber while mendoza waits with his drawn 
sword at the door. ferneze is to be allowed to escape from the chamber 
only to be received on the sword of mendoza who is then to stand over 
the body and pretend that he is guarding it from assault. thus mendoza 
will not only serve pietro but by his seeming generosity towards ferneze 
will earn the gratitude of aurelia who should she attempt to take 
vengeance on her husband will not fail to make mendoza acquainted with 
her plots which he will incontinently reveal to pietro. at the hour 
appointed pietro and the guard invade the duchess chamber the flying 
gallant is stabbed by mendoza and left for dead though he afterwards 
recovers from the wound aurelia receives mendoza again into favour and 
practises with him to murder pietro. mendoza selecting a time when 
pietro had gone ahunting bribes malevole to commit the murder. malevole 
undertakes to kill pietro by stealth in the forest fling his body into 
the sea and then return to announce that pietro distracted by grief at 
the dishonour brought on him by his wife has made away with himself by 
leaping into the sea from a high rock. to the forest goes malevole finds 
pietro and exposes to him the plot presently celso appears bringing a 
hermits weeds into which pietro shifts. they return to the court and the 
pretended hermit describes with much detail how he saw pietro perish the 
narrative being substantiated by malevole. mendoza is proclaimed duke 
and his first act is to pronounce a sentence of perpetual banishment on 
aurelia. he then commissions malevole to bring from the citadel where 
she is confined the wife of the banished altofronto the virtuous maria 
whom he intends to make his duchess. his brain is now exercised to 
procure the destruction of the supposed murderers. malevole is 
instructed to poison the hermit at a supper given in the citadel and the 
hermit on the same occasion is to poison malevole thus two awkward 
agents will be removed and the suspicion will fall on maria whose fears 
will drive her to submit to mendoza. pietro informs malevole of the 
instructions he had received and learns that similar instructions have 
been given to malevole. weighed down with sorrow at his own dishonour 
and disgusted with mendozas villainy pietro declares his determination 
to dedicate his life to religious solitude and make it his one care that 
the banished altofronto shall be restored to the dukedom. thereupon 
malevole puts off his disguise and pietro beholds the banished duke. 
ferneze now approaches with celso and receives pardon from pietro who 
had supposed him to be dead. the four then take counsel how they shall 
depose mendoza. malevole goes to the usurper and announces that he has 
poisoned the hermit he then produces a box of poison which he declares

mendoza opens the box and tries its effects on malevole who feigns to 
fall dead. a masque is ordered by mendoza to be given in honour of maria 
who shows herself indifferent both to the tyrants flatteries and 
threats. at the entertainment malevole pietro and ferneze appear masked 
malevole chooses maria as his partner in the dance and pietro is matched 
with aurelia who has deeply repented of her misconduct. at the close of 
the dance during which malevole and pietro have discovered themselves to 
their partners the maskers environ mendoza level their pistols at his 
head and unmask. altofronto is received with joyful acclamations by the 
assembled company and mendoza whose life the restored duke disdains to 
take is banished with shameful ignominy. beniamino jonsonio poet

the reader. i am an ill orator and in truth use to indite more honestly 
than eloquently for it is my custom to speak as i think and write as i 
speak. in plainness therefore understand that in some things i have 
willingly erred as in supposing a duke of genoa and in taking names 
different from that citys families: for which some may wittily accuse me 
but my defence shall be as honest as many reproofs unto me have been 
most malicious. since i heartily protest it was my care to write so far 
from reasonable offence that even strangers in whose state i laid my 
scene should not from thence draw any disgrace to any dead or living. 
yet in despite of my endeavours i understand some have been most 
unadvisedly overcunning in misinterpreting me and with subtlety as deep 
as hell have maliciously spread ill rumours which springing from 
themselves might to themselves have heavily returned. surely i desire to 
satisfy every firm spirit who in all his actions proposeth to himself no 
more ends than god and virtue do whose intentions are always simple: to 
such i protest that with my free understanding i have not glanced at 
disgrace of any but of those whose unquiet studies labour innovation 
contempt of holy policy reverend comely superiority and established 
unity: for the rest of my supposed tartness i fear not but unto every 
worthy mind it will be approved so general and honest as may modestly 
pass with the freedom of a satire. i would fain leave the paper only one 
thing afflicts me to think that scenes invented merely to be spoken 
should be enforcively published to be read and that the least hurt i can 
receive is to do myself the wrong. but since others otherwise would do 
me more the least inconvenience is to be accepted. i have myself 
therefore set forth this comedy but so that my enforced absence must 
much rely upon the printers discretion: but i shall entreat slight 
errors in orthography may be as slightly overpassed and that the 
unhandsome shape which this trifle in reading presents may be pardoned 
for the pleasure it once afforded you when it was presented with the 
soul of lively action. _sine aliqua dementia nullus phoebus._ for this

_sly._ why we may sit upon the stage at the private house. thou dost not 
take me for a country gentleman dost dost think i fear hissing ill hold 
my life thou tookest me for one of the players. _tireman._ no sir. 
_sly._ by gods slid if you had i would have given you but sixpence for 
your stool. let them that have stale suits sit in the galleries. hiss at 
me he that will be laughed out of a tavern or an ordinary shall seldom 
feed well or be drunk in good company. wheres harry condell dick 
burbadge and william sly let me speak with some of them. _tireman._ ant 
please you to go in sir you may. _sly._ i tell you no: i am one that 
hath seen this play often and can give them intelligence for their 
action: i have most of the jests here in my tablebook. _enter_ sinklo. 
_sinklo._ save you coz _sly._ o cousin come you shall sit between my 
legs here. _sinklo._ no indeed cousin: the audience then will take me 
for a violdegambo and think that you play upon me. _sly._ nay rather 
that i work upon you coz. _sinklo._ we stayed for you at supper last 
night at my cousin honeymoons the woollendraper. after supper we drew 
cuts for a score of apricocks the longest cut still to draw an apricock: 
by this light twas mistress frank honeymoons fortune still to have the 
longest cut: i did measure for the women. what be these coz _enter_ d. 
burbadge h. condell _and_ j. lowin. _sly._ the players. god save you 
_burbadge._ you are very welcome. _sly._ i pray you know this gentleman 
my cousin tis master doomsdays son the usurer. _condell._ i beseech you 
sir be covered. _sly._ no in good faith for mine ease: look you my hats 
the handle to this fan: gods so what a beast was i i did not leave my 
feather at home well but ill take an order with you. _puts his feather 
in his pocket._ _burbadge._ why do you conceal your feather sir _sly._ 
why do you think ill have jests broken upon me in the play to be laughed 
at this play hath beaten all your gallants out of the feathers: 
blackfriars hath almost spoiled blackfriars for feathers. _sinklo._ gods 
so i thought twas for somewhat our gentlewomen at home counselled me to 
wear my feather to the play: yet i am loth to spoil it. _sly._ why coz 
_sinklo._ because i got it in the tiltyard there was a herald broke my 
pate for taking it up: but i have worn it up and down the strand and met 
him forty times since and yet he dares not challenge it. _sly._ do you 
hear sir this play is a bitter play. _condell._ why sir tis neither 
satire nor moral but the mean passage of a history: yet there are a sort 
of discontented creatures that bear a stingless envy to great ones and 
these will wrest the doings of any man to their base malicious appliment 
but should their interpretation come to the test like your marmoset they 
presently turn their teeth to their tail and eat it. _sly._ i will not 
go so far with you but i say any man that hath wit may censure if he sit 
in the twelvepenny room and i say again the play is bitter. _burbadge._ 
sir you are like a patron that presenting a poor scholar to a benefice 
enjoins him not to rail against anything that stands within compass of 
his patrons folly. why should not we enjoy the ancient freedom of poesy 
shall we protest to the ladies that their painting makes them angels or 
to my young gallant that his expenses in the brothel shall gain him 
reputation no sir such vices as stand not accountable to law should be 
cured as men heal tetters by casting ink upon them. would you be 
satisfied in anything else sir _sly._ ay marry would i: i would know how 
you came by this play _condell._ faith sir the book was lost and because 
twas pity so good a play should be lost we found it and play it. _sly._ 
i wonder you would play it another company having interest in it. 
_condell._ why not malevole in folio with us as jeronimo in decimosexto 
with them they taught us a name for our play we call it _one for 
another_. _sly._ what are your additions _burbadge._ sooth not greatly 
needful only as your salad to your great feast to entertain a little 
more time and to abridge the notreceived custom of music in our theatre. 
i must leave you sir. _exit._ _sinklo._ doth he play the malcontent. 
_condell._ yes sir. _sinklo._ i durst lay four of mine ears the play is 
not so well acted as it hath been. _condell._ o no sir nothing _ad 
parmenonis suem_. _lowin._ have you lost your ears sir that you are so 
prodigal of laying them _sinklo._ why did you ask that friend _lowin._ 
marry sir because i have heard of a fellow would offer to lay a 
hundredpound wager that was not worth five baubees: and in this kind you 
might venture four of your elbows yet god defend your coat should have 
so many _sinklo._ nay truly i am no great censurer and yet i might have 
been one of the college of critics once. my cousin here hath an 
excellent memory indeed sir. _sly._ who i ill tell you a strange thing 
of myself and i can tell you for one that never studied the art of 
memory tis very strange too. _condell._ whats that sir _sly._ why ill 
lay a hundred pound ill walk but once down by the goldsmiths row in 
cheap take notice of the signs and tell you them with a breath 
instantly. _lowin._ tis very strange. _sly._ they begin as the world did 
with adam and eve. theres in all just five and fifty. i do use to 
meditate much when i come to plays too. what do you think might come 
into a mans head now seeing all this company _condell._ i know not sir. 
_sly._ i have an excellent thought. if some fifty of the grecians that 
were crammed in the horsebelly had eaten garlic do you not think the 
trojans might have smelt out their knavery _condell._ very likely. 
_sly._ by god i would they had for i love hector horribly. _sinklo._ o 
but coz coz great alexander when he came to the tomb of achilles spake 
with a big loud voice o thou thrice blessd and happy _sly._ alexander 
was an ass to speak so well of a filthy cullion. _lowin._ good sir will 
you leave the stage ill help you to a private room. _sly._ come coz lets 
take some tobacco. have you never a prologue _lowin._ not any sir. 
_sly._ let me see i will make one extempore. _come to them and fencing 
of a congey with arms and legs be round with them._ gentlemen i could 
wish for the womens sakes you had all soft cushions and gentlewomen i 
could wish that for the mens sakes you had all more easy standings. what

the most prodigious affections that ever conversed with nature: a man or 
rather a monster more discontent than lucifer when he was thrust out of

content as from heaven: his highest delight is to procure others 
vexation and therein he thinks he truly serves heaven for tis his 
position whosoever in this earth can be contented is a slave and damned 
therefore does he afflict all in that to which they are most affected. 
the elements struggle within him his own soul is at variance within 
herself his speech is halterworthy at all hours. i like him faith: he 
gives good intelligence to my spirit makes me understand those 
weaknesses which others flattery palliates. hark they sing. _a song._

groweth out a crooked horne of four ynches long. imprinted at london by

beg a person for a fool_ was to apply to be made guardian of a person 
who had been legally proved to be an idiot. it was in the kings power to 
grant the custody of an idiots person and the profits of his estate to 
any subject. gallants prided themselves on wearing spurs that jingled. 
middleton after elaborately describing a young prodigals attire adds: 
lastly he walked the chamber with such a pestilent jingle that his spurs 
oversqueaked the lawyer _works_ viii. . so chapman in _monsieur dolive_: 
you may hear them the gallants half a mile ere they come at you six or

their turn. this is the reading of dyces copy of ed. . other copies

this they cut into pieces and so tear it into thin _flakes which 
naturally it is apt for_ and so use it for glasse lanthorns and such

picturemakers to draw her picture when they have done she most courtly 
finds fault with them one after another and never fetcheth them: they in 
revenge of this execute her in pictures as they do in germany and hang 
her in their shops: by this means is she better known to the stinkards 
than if she had been five times carted. _bil._ fore god an excellent 
policy. _pass._ are there any revels tonight my lord _bil._ yes. _pass._ 
good my lord give me leave to break a fellows pate that hath abused me. 
_bil._ whose pate _pass._ young ferrardo my lord. _bil._ take heed hes 
very valiant i have known him fight eight quarrels in five days believe

_bil._ how prove you that _pass._ why thus. he that quarrels seeks to 
fight and he that seeks to fight seeks to die and he that seeks to die 
seeks never to fight more and he that will quarrel and seeks means never

how dost thou think o this transformation of state now _maq._ verily 
very well for we women always note the falling of the one is the rising 
of the other some must be fat some must be lean some must be fools and 
some must be lords some must be knaves and some must be officers some 
must be beggars some must be knights some must be cuckolds and some must 
be citizens. as for example i have two courtdogs the most fawning curs 
the one called watch the other catch: now i like lady fortune sometimes 
love this dog sometimes raise that dog sometimes favour watch most 
commonly fancy catch. now that dog which i favour i feed and hes so 
ravenous that what i give he never chaws it gulps it down whole without 
any relish of what he has but with a greedy expectation of what he shall 
have. the other dog now _mal._ no more dog sweet maquerelle no more dog.

moment in that _maq._ o believe me a most secret power: look ye a 
chaldean or an assyrian i am sure twas a most sweet jew told me court 
any woman in the right sign you shall not miss. but you must take her in 
the right vein then as when the sign is in pisces a fishmongers wife is 
very sociable in cancer a precisians wife is very flexible in capricorn 
a merchants wife hardly holds out in libra a lawyers wife is very 
tractable especially if her husband be at the term only in scorpio tis 
very dangerous meddling. has the duke sent any jewel any rich stones 
_mal._ ay i think those are the best signs to take a lady in. _enter_ 
captain. by your favour signior i must discourse with the lady maria 
altofronts duchess i must enter for the duke. _capt._ she here shall 
give you interview: i received the guardship of this citadel from the 
good altofront and for his use ill keept till i am of no use. _mal._

what hope hast thou of this duchess easiness _maq._ twill go hard she 
was a cold creature ever she hated monkeys fools jesters and 
gentlemenushers extremely she had the vile trick ont not only to be 
truly modestly honourable in her own conscience but she would avoid the 
least wanton carriage that might incur suspect as god bless me she had 
almost brought bedpressing out of fashion i could scarce get a fine for 
the lease of a ladys favour once in a fortnight. _mal._ now in the name 
of immodesty how many maidenheads has thou brought to the block _maq._ 
let me see: heaven forgive us our misdeeds heres the duchess. _enter_

company _mal._ we have brought thee tender of a husband. _maria._ i hope 
i have one already. _maq._ nay by mine honour madam as good ha neer a 
husband as a banished husband hes in another world now. ill tell ye lady 
i have heard of a sect that maintained when the husband was asleep the 
wife might lawfully entertain another man for then her husband was as 
dead much more when he is banished. _maria._ unhonest creature _maq._ 
pish honesty is but an art to seem so: pray ye whats honesty whats 
constancy but fables feignd odd old fools chat devisd by jealous fools

he will maintain thee royally love thee ardently defend thee powerfully 
marry thee sumptuously and keep thee in despite of rosicleer or donzel

for gods love save poor wretchedness from tyranny of lustful insolence 
enforce me in the deepest dungeon dwell rather than here here round 
about is hell. o my dearst altofront whereer thou breathe let my soul 
sink into the shades beneath before i stain thine honour tis thou hast 
and long as i can die i will live chaste. _mal._ gainst him that can 
enforce how vain is strife _maria._ she that can be enforcd has neer a 
knife: she that through force her limbs with lust enrolls wants 
cleopatras asps and portias coals. god amend you _exit with_ captain. 
_mal._ now the fear of the devil for ever go with thee maquerelle i tell 
thee i have found an honest woman: faith i perceive when all is done 
there is of women as of all other things some good most bad some saints 
some sinners: for as nowadays no courtier but has his mistress no 
captain but has his cockatrice no cuckold but has his horns and no fool 
but has his feather even so no woman but has her weakness and feather 
too no sex but has his i can hunt the letter no farther. _aside_ o god 
how loathsome this toying is to me that a duke should be forced to fool 
it well _stultorum plena sunt omnia_: better play the fool lord than be 
the fool lord. now wheres your sleights madam maquerelle _maq._ why are 
ye ignorant that tis said a squeamish affected niceness is natural to 
women and that the excuse of their yielding is only forsooth the 
difficult obtaining you must put her tot: women are flax and will fire

thou set fire thou inflame her _maq._ marry but ill tell ye now you were 
too hot. _mal._ the fitter to have inflamed the flax woman. _maq._ you 
were too boisterous spleeny for indeed _mal._ go go thou art a weak 
pandress: now i see sooner earths fire heaven itself shall waste than 
all with heat can melt a mind thats chaste. go: thou the dukes limetwig 
ill make the duke turn thee out of thine office: what not get one touch 
of hope and had her at such advantage maq. now o my conscience now i 
think in my discretion we did not take her in the right sign the blood

silence full of heedy stillness makes me thus speak: a voluntary illness 
is merely senseless but unwilling error such as proceeds from too rash

peruse the slighter brakes of our reformd muse who could herself herself

stale use the common bosom of a money creature one that sells human 
flesh a mangonist _free._ alas good creatures what would you have them 
do would you have them get their living by the curse of man the sweat of 
their brows so they do: every man must follow his trade and every woman 
her occupation. a poor decayed mechanical mans wife her husband is laid 
up may not she lawfully be laid down when her husbands only rising is by

grown a sin or relieving the poor and impotent an offence you will say 
beasts take no money for their fleshly entertainment: true because they

best commodities as the draper is more worshipful than the pointmaker 
the silkman more worshipful than the draper and the goldsmith more 
honourable than both little mary so the bawd above all: her shop has the 
best ware for where these sell but cloth satins and jewels she sells 
divine virtues as virginity modesty and such rare gems and those not 
like a petty chapman by retail but like a great merchant by wholesale wa

most rare wealthy knights and most rare bountiful lords are her 
customers. again whereas no trade or vocation profiteth but by the loss 
and displeasure of another as the merchant thrives not but by the 
licentiousness of giddy and unsettled youth the lawyer but by the 
vexation of his client the physician but by the maladies of his patient 
only my smoothgummd bawd lives by others pleasure and only grows rich by 
others rising. o merciful gain o righteous income so much for her 
vocation trade and life. as for their death how can it be bad since 
their wickedness is always before their eyes and a deaths head most

o give me leave to_ c. _cri._ pish sister beatrice prithee read no more 
my stomach o late stands against kissing extremely. _bea._ why good 
crispinella _cri._ by the faith and trust i bear to my face tis grown 
one of the most unsavoury ceremonies: body o beauty tis one of the most 
unpleasing injurious customs to ladies: any fellow that has but one nose 
on his face and standing collar and skirts also lined with taffety 
sarcenet must salute us on the lips as familiarly soft skins save us 
there was a stubbearded johnastile with a ploydens face saluted me last 
day and struck his bristles through my lips i ha spent ten shillings in 
pomatum since to skin them again. marry if a nobleman or a knight with 
one lock visit us though his unclean gooseturdgreen teeth ha the palsy 
his nostrils smell worse than a putrified marrowbone and his loose beard 
drops into our bosom yet we must kiss him with a cursy a curse for my 
part i had as lieve they would break wind in my lips. _bea._ fie 
crispinella you speak too broad. _cri._ no jot sister lets neer be 
ashamed to speak what we be not ashamed to think: i dare as boldly speak 
venery as think venery. _bea._ faith sister ill begone if you speak so 
broad. _cri._ will you so now bashfulness seize you we pronounce boldly 
robbery murder treason which deeds must needs be far more loathsome than 
an act which is so natural just and necessary as that of procreation you 
shall have an hypocritical vestal virgin speak that with close teeth 
publicly which she will receive with open mouth privately for my own 
part i consider nature without apparel without disguising of custom or 
compliment i give thoughts words and words truth and truth boldness she 
whose honest freeness makes it her virtue to speak what she thinks will 
make it her necessity to think what is good. i love no prohibited things 
and yet i would have nothing prohibited by policy but by virtue for as 
in the fashion of time those books that are calld in are most in sale 
and request so in nature those actions that are most prohibited are most 
desired. _bea._ good quick sister stay your pace we are private but the 
world would censure you for truly severe modesty is womens virtue. 
_cri._ fie fie virtue is a free pleasant buxom quality. i love a 
constant countenance well but this froward ignorant coyness sour austere 
lumpish uncivil privateness that promises nothing but rough skins and 
hard stools ha fie ont good for nothing but for nothing. well nurse and 
what do you conceive of all this _put._ nay faith my conceiving days be 
done. marry for kissing ill defend that thats within my compass but for 
my own part heres mistress beatrice is to be married with the grace of 
god a fine gentleman he is shall have her and i warrant a strong he has 
a leg like a post a nose like a lion a brow like a bull and a beard of 
most fair expectation: this week you must marry him and i now will read 
a lecture to you both how you shall behave yourselves to your husbands 
the first month of your nuptial i ha broke my skull about it i can tell 
you and there is much brain in it. _cri._ read it to my sister good 
nurse for i assure you ill neer marry. _put._ marry god forfend what 
will you do then _cri._ faith strive against the flesh. marry no faith 
husbands are like lots in the lottery: you may draw forty blanks before 
you find one that has any prize in him. a husband generally is a 
careless domineering thing that grows like coral which as long as it is 
under water is soft and tender but as soon as it has got his branch 
above the waves is presently hard stiff not to be bowed but burst so 
when your husband is a suitor and under your choice lord how supple he 
is how obsequious how at your service sweet lady once married got up his 
head above a stiff crooked nobby inflexible tyrannous creature he grows 
then they turn like water more you would embrace the less you hold. ill 
live my own woman and if the worst come to the worst i had rather prove 
a wag than a fool. _bea._ o but a virtuous marriage. _cri._ virtuous 
marriage there is no more affinity betwixt virtue and marriage than 
betwixt a man and his horse indeed virtue gets up upon marriage 
sometimes and manageth it in the right way but marriage is of another 
piece for as a horse may be without a man and a man without a horse so 
marriage you know is often without virtue and virtue i am sure more oft 
without marriage. but thy match sister by my troth i think twill do well 
hes a wellshaped cleanlippd gentleman of a handsome but not affected

imperial seat of libya governd by statesmen each as great as kings for 
seventeen kings were carthage feodars whilst thus she flourishd whilst 
her hannibal made rome to tremble and the walls yet pale: then in this 
carthage sophonisba lived the farfamed daughter of great asdrubal: for 
whom mongst others potent syphax sues and wellgraced massinissa rivals 
him both princes of proud sceptres: but the lot of doubtful favour 
massinissa graced at which syphax grows black: for now the night yields 
loud resoundings of the nuptial pomp: apollo strikes his harp hymen his 
torch whilst louring juno with illboding eye sits envious at too forward 
venus. lo the instant night: and now ye worthier minds to whom we shall 
present a female glory the wonder of a constancy so fixd that fate 
itself might well grow envious: be pleased to sit such as may merit oil 
and holy dew stilld from diviner heat. for rest thus knowing: what of

wellstrung limbs with glossful steel whats safe to carthage shall be

my choice vexd syphax enraged syphax struck arms fate yet sophonisba not 
repents: o we were gods if that we knew events. but let my lord leave 
carthage quit his virtue i will not love him yet must honour him as 
still good subjects must bad princes. lords from the most illgraced 
hymeneal bed that ever juno frownd at i entreat that youll collect from 
our looseformd speech this firm resolve: that no low appetite of my sex 
weakness can or shall oercome due grateful service unto you or virtue. 
witness ye gods i never until now repined at my creation: now i wish i 
were no woman that my arms might speak my heart to carthage. but in 
vain: my tongue swears i am woman still i talk too long. _cornets a

wars rage admits no anchor since the billow is risen so high we may not 
hull but yield this ample state to stroke of speedy swords what you with 
sober haste have well decreed well put to sudden arms no not this night 
these dainties these firstfruits of nuptials that well might give excuse 
for feeble lingerings shall hinder massinissa. appetite kisses loves 
dalliance and what softer joys the venus of the pleasingst ease can 
minister i quit you all. virtue perforce is vice but he that may yet 
holds is manly wise. lo then ye lords of carthage to your trust i leave 
all massinissas treasure: by the oath of right good men stand to my 
fortune just: most hard it is for great hearts to mistrust. _car._ we 
vow by all high powers. _mass._ no do not swear i was not born so small 
to doubt or fear. _so._ worthy my lord _mass._ peace my ears are steel i 
must not hear thy muchenticing voice. _so._ my massinissa sophonisba 
speaks worthy thy wife: go with as high a hand as worth can rear. i will 
not stay my lord. fight for our country vent thy youthful heat in field 
not beds: the fruit of honour fame be rather gotten than the oft 
disgrace of hapless parents children. go best man and make me proud to 
be a soldiers wife that values his renown above faint pleasures: think

preposterous zeal as stand against the full decree of senate all think 
fit _car._ nay most inevitable necessary for carthage safety and the now 
sole good of present state that we must break all faith with massinissa. 
whilst he fights abroad lets gain back syphax making him our own by 
giving sophonisba to his bed. _han._ syphax is massinissas greater and 
his force shall give more side to carthage: as fors queen and her wise 
father they love carthage fate profit and honesty are not one in state. 
_gel._ and what decrees our very virtuous senate of worthy massinissa 
that now fights and leaving wife and bed bleeds in good arms for right 
old carthage _car._ thus tis thought fit: her father asdrubal on sudden 
shall take in revolted syphax so with doubled strength before that 
massinissa shall suspect slaughter both massinissa and his troops and 
likewise strike with his deep stratagem a sudden weakness into scipios 
arms by drawing such a limb from the main body of his yet powerful army: 
which being done dead massinissas kingdom we decree to sophonisba and 
great asdrubal for their consent so this swift plot shall bring two 
crowns to her make asdrubal a king. _gel._ so first faiths breach murder 
adultery theft _car._ what else _gel._ nay all is done no mischief left. 
_car._ pish prosperous success gives blackest actions glory the means 
are unrememberd in most story. _gel._ let me not say gods are not. 
_car._ this is fit: conquest by blood is not so sweet as wit: for 
howsoeer nice virtue censures it he hath the grace of war that hath wars 
profit. but carthage well advised that states come on with slow advice 
quick execution have here an engineer long bred for plots calld an 
impoisner who knows this sound excuse: th only dew that makes men sprout 
in court is use. bet well or ill his thrift is to be mute such slaves 
must act commands and not dispute. knowing foul deeds with danger do 
begin but with rewards do end: sin is no sin but in respects _gel._ 
politic lord speak low: though heaven bears a face far from us gods have 
most long ears jove has a hundred marble marble hands. _car._ o ay in 
poetry or tragic scene _gel._ i fear gods only know what poets mean. 
_car._ yet hear me i will speak close truth and cease: nothing in nature 
is unserviceable no not even inutility itself. is then for nought 
dishonesty in being and if it be sometimes of forcd use wherein more 
urgent than in saving nations state shapes are solderd up with base nay 
faulty yet necessary functions: some must lie some must betray some 
murder and some all each hath strong use as poison in all purges: yet 
when some violent chance shall force a state to break given faith or 
plot some stratagems princes ascribe that vile necessity unto heavens 
wrath. and sure thought be no vice yet tis bad chance: states must not 
stick too nice for massinissas death sense bids forgive: beware toffend 
great men and let them live for tis of empires body the main arm he that 
will do no good shall do no harm. you have my mind. _gel._ although a 
stagelike passion and weak heat full of an empty wording might suit age 
know ill speak strongly truth. lords neer mistrust that he wholl not 
betray a private man for his country will neer betray his country for 
private men then give gelosso faith. if treachery in state be 
serviceable let hangmen do it. i am bound to lose my life but not mine 
honour for my country. our vows our faith our oaths why theyre ourselves 
and he thats faithless to his proper self may be excusd if he break 
faith with princes. the gods assist just hearts and states that trust 
plots before providence are tossd like dust. for massinissa o let me 
slack a little austere discourse and feel humanity methinks i hear him 
cry o fight for carthage charge home wounds smart not for that so just 
so great so good a city. methinks i see him yet leave his fair bride 
even on his nuptial night to buckle on his arms for carthage. hark yet 
yet i hear him cry ingratitude vile stain of man o ever be most far from 
massinissas breast up march amain fame got by loss of breath is godlike 
gain and see by this he bleeds in doubtful fight and cries for carthage 
whilst carthage memory forsake gelosso would i could not think nor hear 
nor be when carthage is so infinitely vile see see look here _cornets.

scrapes dry gums for her black rites but when she finds a corpse but 
newly graved whose entrails are not turnd to slimy filth with greedy 
havock then she makes fierce spoil and swells with wicked triumph to 
bury her lean knuckles in his eyes then doth she gnaw the pale and 
oergrown nails from his dry hand but if she find some life yet lurking 
close she bites his gelid lips and sticking her black tongue in his dry 
throat she breathes dire murmurs which enforce him bear her baneful

great heart sunk with shame his eyes lost spirit and his heat of life 
sank from his face as one that stood benumbd all mazed teffect 
impossibilities for either unto her or scipio he must break vow. long 
time he tossd his thoughts and as you see a snowball being rolld at 
first a handful yet long bowld about insensibly acquires a mighty globe 
so his cold grief through agitation grows and more he thinks the more of 
grief he knows. at last he seemd to yield her. _sy._ mark scipio trust
